In the context of the European Union (EU), directives are [[Legislation|legislative]] acts that set out specific goals and objectives that all EU Member States *must achieve within a certain period of time. 


Member States have some flexibility in how they implement directives, as long as they achieve the overall objectives set out in the directive

Directives are one of the primary means by which the EU creates harmonized laws and regulations that apply across all Member States.


The key difference between directives and [[Regulation|regulations]] is that regulations *must* be implemented entirely in each member state, while directives essentially just say "you have to fulfill these goals, you can figure out how to do so yourself".
