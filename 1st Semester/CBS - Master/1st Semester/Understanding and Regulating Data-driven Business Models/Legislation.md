Legislation is the process of creating, passing, and enforcing laws through a formal system of rules and procedures.

In a democratic system of government, legislation is typically carried out by a legislative body, such as a parliament or congress, which is responsible for drafting and passing laws that apply to all citizens and organizations within their jurisdiction.
