Non-response error is a type of [[Non-sampling Errors|non-sampling error]], which occurs when individuals do not respond or participate in the [[Surveys|survey]]. 

This is an issue, as those who don't respond may have different characteristics than those who respond, which can lead to a more biased [[Sample|sample]].


#### *How to deal with Non-response Error*
- Use clear and unbiased survey questions
- Keep surveys short and focused
- Use multiple modes of survey administration to reach a wider range of individuals
- Offering incentives for participation
	- Material incentives:
		-   E.g. prepaid/post-paid cash, coupons, or certificates
		-   Caution: May have effect of creating a group who can use technology to find and respond to web-based surveys purely for profit
	-   Non-material incentives
		-   E.g. provide summary report, address confidentiality concerns

###### Increasing response rate in web-based surveys:
-   Invitations to participate in web-based surveys are often sent via E-mail, so pay attention to:
	-   E-mail invitation headers: sender, recipient, and subject line
	-   The content of e-mail invitations
	-   E-mail reminders
	-   Sending it from an institution etc.

-   Improving response rate through design
	-   Digital images and access issues
	-   Lay-outs: scrolling vs. Paging
	-   Announcing completion time and progress indicators
		-   Number of experts say web-based should be around 10min
		-   Progress indicators in some cases may increase abandonment
