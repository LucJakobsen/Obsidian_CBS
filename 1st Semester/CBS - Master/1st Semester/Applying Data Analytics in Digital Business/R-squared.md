R-squared (coefficient of determination) is a measure of the overall quality of the [[Regression]] model. It is a number between 0.0 and 1.0
- A higher R-squared means the regression model is a better fit to the data

It represents the proportion of variance in the [[Dependent Variable|dependent variable]] (Y) that can be explained by the [[Independent Variable|independent variables]] (X)
