Write some more stuff about t-test, P-values, and confidence intervals - relate it to hypothesis testing

95% confidence interval --> we can with 95% certainty say the value is within the interval

P-value for 95% confidence interval --> if below 0.05 you reject null hypothesis

We formulate a hypothesis that we want to reject (null hypothesis)
- Do not accept the alternative hypothesis
- Much stronger to reject hypothesis



You always need one dummy variable less than categories you have



## Workshop
- What is the design factor/treatment variable that you manipulated  
in the experiment?  
Advertising - independent variable, the one we have control over

• How many purchases and newsletter signups did you measure  
during the experimental period?  
207,515 people purchased something

350,225 people signed up for the newsletter during the period

• How many consumers in the control group signed up for the  
newsletter or conducted a purchase? How many consumers in  
the treatment group signed up for the newsletter or conducted a  
purchase?

Control group: 252,496

Treatment group: 305,244


• Was the randomization effective?

- You look at if the groups are e

### Should also look at operating system randomization

##### Looking at randomization for previous purchases by customers
![[Pasted image 20230314091448.png]]

- Examine if the customers who previously purchased something was equally/randomly assigned to each group
- P-value of 0.94 --> we cannot reject the null hypothesis --> there is no difference between between the groups in terms of if customers purchased something previously or not


• Was the advertising effective? How effective was  
the advertising?  
#### Look at both newsletter signups and purchases against advertising
ttest newsletter by advertising


• The firm is investing 2DKK per user that is  
confronted with ads and has a profit margin of  
80DKK per bottle of wine sold. Should the firm  
advertise to consumers?
- Increase in purchase probability = 2%
- To generate 1 purchase because of advertising, we need to adress 50 consumers on average
- Costs on average 100DKK advertising expenses per purchase. The costs are higher than the profit margin of 80DKK
- Firm also gets value from advertising due to newsletter signups
- Generates 2.5 newsletter signup with one purchase with advertising
