The Measurement Model is a type of [[Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)|structural equation model]], that specifies the relationships between the observed and latent variables ([[Construct|constructs]]).

It is used to assess the [[Validity|validity]] and [[Reliability|reliability]] of the measures used in the study, and to test whether the observed variables are measuring the same construct as the construct they are intended to represent.

In a measurement model, the items are observed and cocnrete, but the latent variables are unobserved and abstract.

In a measurement model, the latent variable is represented as a circle or oval, and the observed variables are represented as rectangles or boxes. 

The lines connecting the observed variables to the latent variable represent the factor loadings or pattern coefficients, which describe the strength and direction of the relationship between the observed variable and the latent variable.
