Sampling Errors refer to the errors which occur from the difference between the [[Sample|sample]] and the [[Population|population]].

If the sample does not represent the population well there is a large sample error. 

As such, it is generally that: the bigger the sample, the lower the sample error
- As it will be more representative


There are two types of sampling errors, which can occur when identifying the [[Sampling Frame|sampling frame]]:
1. [[Error of Omission]]
2. [[Error of Inclusion]]
