Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is one the methods utilized for assessing [[Construct Validity|construct validity]]. In other words, it measures the [[Goodness of Fit]] It typically produces a [[Chi-squared Test|chi-squared test]] [[Statistic|statistic]].

The basic question related to the CFA is: ***"does the data "fit" our specified model?"***

To see whether the data fits the specified model, you typically look at the [[Loadings|loadings]] of the [[Items|items]] on the [[Construct|constructs]]. 
- Items should have *high* loadings on the construct they are intended to measure
- Items should have *no* loadings on the construct they are *not* intended to measure

In CFA, the [[Chi-squared Test|chi-squared test]] is often used in conjunction with other fit indices, such as the [[Comparative Fit Index (CFI)]], the [[Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI)]], and the [[Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)]], to evaluate the overall fit of the model.


For CFA there should be no [[Loadings#Cross Loading|cross loadings]] and no correlated errors.
- For example, in the two-factor model item 3 should not have loading on fairness perception. And errors 3 and 4 should not be correlated.

The image shows three factors (or constructs) (the F's) to the right, which have been measured by different items (X1 etc.). We would then like to know if the collected data (left) matches the constructs. 

#### Example: A Two-factor Model
![[Pasted image 20230306193213.png]]
- Two constructs:
	1. Fairness Perception
	2. Trust in Supervisor

- Four items:
	1. My supervisor is fair
	2. My supervisor treats us without biases
	3. I believe that my supervisor will protect me
	4. I trust my supervisor

Item 3 and 4 measure *trust in supervisor*  (construct 2), item 1 and 2 measure *fairness perception* (construct 1)

Measurement errors are added to the equation (absalon symbol).

**A good two-factor model will therefore look as follows:**

The two constructs may be correlated but nothing else touches each other
