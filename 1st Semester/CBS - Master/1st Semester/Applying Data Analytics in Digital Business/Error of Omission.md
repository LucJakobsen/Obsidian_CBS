Error of inclusion is a type of [[Sampling Errors|sampling error]], which occurs when there is data/people that are in the [[Population|population]] of interest but are not in the [[Sampling Frame|sampling frame]] (are left out).

**Examples** of erorr of omission could be:
- The company didn't provide a complete customer list, just at set of 5000
- People who are still in their free trial period haven't had to submit phone numbers yet

#### *How to deal with Errors of Omission:*
-   If population characteristics are known, measure them in your sample and compare to see if they are approximately equivalent
	-   In essence: check if your sample is representative
	-   **Example:** if your target population is 65% 60 year olds, but your sample only has 5% 60 years or older, there's an issue!

-   If population characteristics are known and are measured in your sample, you can apply sampling weights
	-   Numerical values assigned to each unit in a sample to adjust for differences in probability of selection or response rates
	-   Sampling weights re-balance the data set so the sampled data set represents the target population as closely as possible
	-   Doesn't necessarily solve the problem, but helps alleviate it

-   Create additional sampling frame
	-   E.g. if your first sampling frame resulted in an underrepresentation of women in your sample, you may seek out an additional sampling frame where you are more confident that you can find a more appropriate representation of women

-   Honestly report the potential limitations of your sampling frame
	-   And include a thoughtful discussion in your report about how your results may be flawed
