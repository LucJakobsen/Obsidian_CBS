Demand characteristics are a type of [[Bias]] that refers to when participants want to please the experimenter. 
- I.e. they are cues or features of a research study that can influence study participants to behave or respond in a particular way, by indicating what the researcher expects to find

Some types of demand characteristics could e.g. be:
- [[Hawthorne Effect]]
- [[Response Bias]]
- [[Social Desirability Bias]]

#### How to Counter-act Demand Characteristics
- Give participants enough context to avoid them seeking the purpose of the research (transparency)

- Provide a cover story

- Deception:
	- Stay within ethical norms and debrief participants
	- Request secrecy
