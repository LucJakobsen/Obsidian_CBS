Full Factorial Design is a type of [[Experiment]] design with two or more [[Independent Variable|factors]], and in which all possible combinations of the [[Factor Levels|factor levels]] are considered.

It involves studying the effects of multiple independent variables (factors) simultaneously on a dependent variable by testing all possible combinations of the levels of these variables.

Allows the researcher to investigate the impact of each factor on the [[Dependent Variable|response variable]] as well as the effect of their interactions

When dealing with multiple factors, it is important to consider the strength of [[Interaction Effects]].

### Example
If a study is testing the effects of two factors, A and B, each with two levels (high and low), then a full factorial design would involve testing all four possible combinations of these levels: (A-high, B-high), (A-high, B-low), (A-low, B-high), and (A-low, B-low).


### Analyzing Full Factorial Designs ([[Between-subject Experiment|between-subject designs]])
- [[T-test|T-tests]] can be used to test the difference of the mean outcome for a factor with two levels

- For factors with more than two levels, for several factors simultaneously, or for the effect of a continuous variable, we need to use:
