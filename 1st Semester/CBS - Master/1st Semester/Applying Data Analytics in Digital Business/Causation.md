Causation is the relationship between cause and effect. 

I.e. it is the relationship between an event (the cause) and a second event (the effect), where the second event is a result of the first

Causation is used to explain outcomes and is typically used in [[Hypothesis Testing]]. It is often determined through [[Experimentation]]. 

The role of causation is **heavily dependent** on the perspective and the role of the question asked.
- E.g. if there is a correlation between number of accidents and the car colour red, then:
	- an insurance company may not be interested in causality, simply the fact that there is a relationship (so they can price discriminate)
	- the buyer may be interested in casuality as it may influence their decision to buy the car in red or otherwise

***Important to remember!:*** [[Correlation]] does not mean causation.
