Predictive analysis is all about using data to build predictive models for better decision-making, and ultimately add more value.

It uses statistical algorithms, machine learning techniques, and data mining to identify patterns and predict future outcomes based on historical data.
- So it's all about making informed predictions about future trends

Predictive analysis can deal with both big data and "small" data, and can analyse both [[Cross-sectional Dataset|cross-sectional]] and [[Longitudinal dataset|longitudinal]] datasets.



There are various techniques for predictive analysis, e.g.:
- [[CBS - Master/1st Semester/Applying Data Analytics in Digital Business/Regression]]
- [[Decision Trees]]
- [[Neural Networks]]
- [[Random Forests]]
- Etc.
