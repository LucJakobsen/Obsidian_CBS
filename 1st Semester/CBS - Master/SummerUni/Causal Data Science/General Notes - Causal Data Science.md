### Lecture 1
Causality remains important as it may influence the results and interpretations we can gain from data. 

See e.g. the Google case (underpaying men vs. women)
- Average (mean) vs. adjust average (adjusted mean)
- You can find completely opposite answers based on how you view the data
- Data doesn't have all the answers, we require extra assumptions

There are no definite answers in causal inference --> it depends on the assumptions you have bring and have

Always consider if the data is equally distributed etc.
