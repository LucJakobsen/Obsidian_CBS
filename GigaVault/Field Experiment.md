A field experiment is a type of [[Experiment]] that is being conducted in a natural setting. 

As such, a field experiment is more uncontrollable, compared to e.g. a [[Lab Experiment]].

The key question when performing a lab experiment is about the [[External Validity]]:
*"Can causal inference be generalized to and across other units, treatments, observations, settings?"*
- I.e. can you infer something from the experiment on the [[Sample|sample]], about the [[Population|population]]


#### Pros of Field Experiments
- Often larger sample size possible
- More realistic setting that allows to measure real responses without subjects being aware of experiment
- "Representative, randomly chosen, non-self-selected subset of the treatment population of interest"

#### Cons of Field Experiments
- Complex and uncontrollable setting that raise issues of unobserved variables
- Requires access to the right setting and managerial support
