#### Poland vs. EU Case
**Resume:** [CURIA - Dokumenter (europa.eu)](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=258263&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=756630)


So basically the case is about Poland vs. EU about article 17 of the Digital Service Market (DSM).

DSM is about creating a single market for digital goods and services in EU by eliminating cross-border barriers for online trade. Article 17 basically says online content-sharing platforms have to take measures to prevent illegal stuff being shared.

Poland doesn't like article 17, basically they say that it will require the platforms to continually monitor the content and will interfere with the fundamental right of free speech, since it would limit freedom of expression

*"It submits, in essence, that those provisions require the providers to carry out – by means of IT tools for automatic filtering – preventive monitoring of all the content which their users wish to upload, without providing safeguards to ensure that the right to freedom of expression and information is respected. ([3](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=258263&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=756630#Footnote3))*"

And the EU basically ended up saying "nah this ain't it, this works fine and will still protect fundamental rights such as freedom of speech"

*It dismisses Poland’s action, holding that the obligation of the providers, laid down by that directive, to carry out a prior automatic review of the content uploaded by users, is accompanied by appropriate safeguards in order to ensure respect for the right to freedom of expression and information of those users and a fair balance between that right and the right to intellectual property*



#### Questions
1.  The parties involved were the Republic of Poland, the European Parliament, and the Council of the European Union.
    
2.  The competing fundamental rights at issue were the right to freedom of expression and the right to intellectual property protection.
    
3.  Poland's main argument was that the Directive's provisions regarding the liability of online content-sharing platforms for copyright-infringing content would restrict freedom of expression and violate the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, the CJEU ultimately rejected this argument and upheld the legality of the Directive.
    
4.  Between paragraphs 39 and 58, the CJEU examined whether Article 17 (formerly Article 13) of the Directive, which establishes the liability regime for online content-sharing platforms, would limit the right to freedom of expression. The CJEU concluded that the provision was compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights and that it did not impose a general obligation on online content-sharing platforms to monitor content or restrict user-generated content before it is uploaded.
    
5.  The CJEU applied the principle of proportionality to balance the competing fundamental rights at issue. The court found that the measures established by Article 17 of the Directive were appropriate and necessary to achieve the objective of protecting copyright and that they did not go beyond what was necessary to achieve that objective. The CJEU also found that the provision contained sufficient safeguards to protect freedom of expression.
    
6.  The impact of the case for hosting platforms is that they will have to ensure they are compliant with the Directive's provisions regarding copyright-infringing content. The stakes for users and content creators are that their content may be subject to more rigorous filtering and monitoring by hosting platforms, which could lead to some content being removed or blocked. However, the CJEU's decision also provides some level of protection for freedom of expression and ensures that hosting platforms are held accountable for copyright infringement
