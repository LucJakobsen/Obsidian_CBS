Interaction occur when the effect of one variable on an outcome, depends on the level or value of another variable.

So essentially, it's when one variable affects the strength of the [[Causation|causal effect]] of another variable

Interaction effects can be measured with either [[ANOVA]] or [[OLS Regression|Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression]]
