Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a statistical measure used to compare treatments (or interventions)

The ATE measures the difference in mean outcomes between the treatment and the control
- Typically a treatment group and a control group

In our case, treatment could e.g. be education
- So we e.g. compare difference in salary for those who have statistics education and those who don't

The effects are likely to differ between individuals
