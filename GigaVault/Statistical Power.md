Statistical power is the ability of a statistical test to detect a true effect or difference when it exists. In other words, it is the probability of correctly rejecting the [[Null Hypothesis]] when it is false. 

A test with high statistical power is more likely to detect a true effect or difference than a test with low statistical power.
- Typically we say if the power is above 0.8 it is acceptable (strong)

Statistical power is affected by several factors, including the [[Sample]] size, the [[Significance Level]], the effect size, and the variability of the data, etc.


I.e. the statistical power depends on:
- The [[Significance Level]] (alpha)
- The magnitude of the effect of interest in the population (how large or small the estimate of the coefficient is ([[Confidence Interval]]))
- The sample size used to detect the effect


##### Key note!
Usually the information required to estimate the power is not directly available. The researcher needs to make reasonable assumptions about the effect sizes and standard deviation
