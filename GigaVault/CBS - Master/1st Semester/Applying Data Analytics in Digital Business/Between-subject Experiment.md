Between-subject Experiment refers to when participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, and each group is exposed to a different treatment

So you look at the treatmentÂ´s effect *between* different groups 

Each participant is exposed to only one treatment, and the researcher measures the outcome variable(s) for each group



#### Example
In a study investigating the effect of a new medication on blood pressure, participants might be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group, which receives the medication, or the control group, which receives a placebo. 

The researcher would then measure the blood pressure of each participant after a certain period of time and compare the mean scores between the two groups to determine if the medication had a significant effect on blood pressure.
