1.  <u>Data Management Commands</u>: These commands are used to manipulate and manage datasets. Some common data management commands in STATA include:

-   ``import:`` reads data into STATA from external sources
-   ``merge:`` combines two or more datasets into a single dataset
-   ``generate``: creates new variables based on existing variables
-   ``drop``: removes variables from a dataset
-   ``recode``: changes the values of variables

2.  <u>Descriptive Statistics Commands</u>: These commands are used to compute summary statistics and other measures of central tendency and variability. Some common descriptive statistics commands in STATA include:

-   ``summarize``: computes summary statistics for variables in a dataset
-   ``tabulate``: creates frequency tables for categorical variables
-   ``histogram``: creates a histogram of a continuous variable
-   ``correlation``: computes the correlation between variables

3.  <u>Regression Analysis Commands</u>: These commands are used to perform regression analysis and model relationships between variables. Some common regression analysis commands in STATA include:

-   ``regress``: performs linear regression analysis
-   ``logistic``: performs logistic regression analysis
-   ``probit``: performs probit regression analysis
-   ``robust``: performs robust regression analysis

4.  <u>Graphical Commands</u>: These commands are used to create various types of graphs and plots. Some common graphical commands in STATA include:

-   ``scatter``: creates a scatter plot of two variables
-   ``line``: creates a line plot of one or more variables
-   ``bar``: creates a bar plot of one or more variables
-   ``box``: creates a box plot of one or more variables

5.  <u>Panel Data Commands</u>: These commands are used for analyzing panel data, which is data collected over time for the same individuals or entities. Some common panel data commands in STATA include:

-   ``xtreg``: performs panel data regression analysis
-   ``xtsum``: computes summary statistics for panel data
-   ``xtline``: creates a line plot of panel data
