Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a statistical measure used to compare treatments (or interventions). It is commonly used in [[Experimentation|experimentation]] to estimate the average causal effect of a treatment on an outcome variable

The ATE measures the difference in mean outcomes between the treatment and the control group

It is typically calculated as follows:
``ATE = (average outcome for treatment group) - (average outcome for control group)``


In our case, treatment could e.g. be education
- So we e.g. compare difference in salary for those who have statistics education and those who don't

The effects are likely to differ between individuals
