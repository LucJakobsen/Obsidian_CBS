A chi-squared test is a statistical test that is used to compare the observed frequencies of a categorical (nominal or ordinal) variable with the expected frequencies.

Chi-squared tests can be used to test hypotheses about the distribution of a categorical variable, or to test for associations or independence between two categorical variables. 
- In a chi-squared test, the [[Null Hypothesis|null hypothesis]] is that there is no significant difference between the observed data and the expected data


Statistically non-significant values of chi-square generally indicate a better degree of fit
- So, the smaller the value the better



***Important note:*** The chi-squared test can be sensitive to [[Sample|sample]] size and model complexity
- Large sample sizes or more complex models may produce statistically significant chi-squared values even when the model fits well in practice
