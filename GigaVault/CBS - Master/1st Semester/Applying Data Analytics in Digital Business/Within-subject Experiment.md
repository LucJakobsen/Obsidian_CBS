Within-subject Experiment refers to when each participant is exposed to all levels of the [[Independent Variable|independent variable]] / treatment.
- So each participant is exposed to several combinations of treatments

So one particiapant tests all the different treatments and we look at which treatment was most effective
- I.e. all the treatments are applied *within* one group

The opposite of within-subject experiment would be a [[Between-subject Experiment]]

Compared to between-subject design, within-subject design will have twice as many observations

Within-subject experiments are very useful for *marketing*

#### Example
In a study on the effects of caffeine on reaction time, participants might be tested twice, once after consuming a caffeinated beverage and once after consuming a placebo. 

By comparing each participant's reaction time after consuming caffeine and after consuming a placebo, the researchers can determine if caffeine has an effect on reaction time

#### Importance of Randomization for Within-subject Design
Randomize the order of [[Factor Levels|factor levels]] that participants go through to rule out learning and order effects that [[Bias|bias]] your results
- So you randomize the order of the treatments

### Advantages of Within-subject Design
- Requires fewer participants
- Minimize the random noise
	- Exact same participant experiences all conditions

### Disadvantages of Within-subject Design
- More difficult to analyze as observations are not independent
	- Special attributes from a participant that may affect the study would carry-over to each treatment
