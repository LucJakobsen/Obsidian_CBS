Within-subject Experiment refers to when each participant is exposed to all levels of the [[Independent Variable|independent variable]] / treatment.

So one particiapant tests all the different treatments and we look at which treatment was most effective
- I.e. all the treatments are applied *within* one group


#### Example
In a study on the effects of caffeine on reaction time, participants might be tested twice, once after consuming a caffeinated beverage and once after consuming a placebo. 

By comparing each participant's reaction time after consuming caffeine and after consuming a placebo, the researchers can determine if caffeine has an effect on reaction time
