#flashcards 
A population is :: an entire collection of people, firms, states or things that we are interested in, and which we want to describe, explain, or predict.

The population is the group to which the researcher wants to generalize their findings.

In practice, it is often difficult or impractical to study an entire population. Instead a [[Sample|sample]] is chosen for study/research. 


A study performed on the ENTIRE population is known as :: a census.
