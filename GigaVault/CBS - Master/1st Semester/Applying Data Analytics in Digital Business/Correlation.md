Correlation refers to the degree to which two or more [[Variable|variables]] are related or associated with each other. It is typically measured using a [[Correlation Coefficient]]. 

I.e. correlation is merely a relationship.

Correlation can be used to observe one variable and then anticipate/predict how the other variable will move.
- Variables either move in same or opposite direction


***Important to remember!:*** Correlation does not mean [[Causation|causation]].
