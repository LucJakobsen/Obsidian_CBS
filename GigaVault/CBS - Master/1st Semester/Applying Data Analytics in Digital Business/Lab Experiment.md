A lab experiment is a type of [[Experiment]] which is conducted in a controlled setting. 

A lab experiment is therefore in opposition to a [[Field Experiment]], which is less controllable.

The key question when performing a lab experiment is about the [[Internal Validity]]: 
*"Does the experiment allow causal inference?"*
- I.e. can you say that there is a relationship between the [[Independent Variable|independent]] and [[Dependent Variable|dependent variables]], while controlling for other factors that may influence the results.


#### Pros of Lab Experiments
- More controlled environment
- More [[Variable|variables]] can be measured/observed

#### Cons of Lab Experiments
- More expensive
- Risk of introducing [[Bias|biases]]: experimenter, confounds, demand characteristics: Behaviour often changes when people know they are being observed (Hawthorne effect)
