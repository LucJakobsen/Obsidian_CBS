Censoring refers to when subject are lost to follow up or drop out of the study, or if the study ends before the outcome of interest
- They are counted as 'alive' or 'disease-free' for the time they were enrolled in the study
	- (([[Survival Analysis]] has it roots in medical research))
	- If drop-out is related to both outcome and treatment, drop-outs may bias the results
		- So we usually wanna know why people drop out

So censoring is basically when some individuals in a study do not experience the event of interest during the study period


### Main reasons for censoring
- The study ends (they outlive it)
- The individual withdrew from the study/lost to follow-up
- The individual died from other causes
- The individual is ineligible for research because of other reasons


### How to deal with censoring
- [[Kaplan-Meier Method]]
- [[Cox Regression Model]]
