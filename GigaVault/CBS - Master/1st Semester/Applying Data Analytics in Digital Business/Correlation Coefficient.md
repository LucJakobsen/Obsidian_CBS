The Correlation coefficient is a number, it is a [[Properties|property]] of the data - something we can compute for any pair of datasets. 

It indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between the variables. 


A correlation coefficient can range from -1 to +1
- Values closer to -1 indicates a negative correlation 
	- when one variable increases, the other decreases
- Values closer to +1 indicates a positive correlation 
	- when one variable increases, the other also increases
- Value of 0 indicates no correlation 
	- when there is no relationship between the variables
