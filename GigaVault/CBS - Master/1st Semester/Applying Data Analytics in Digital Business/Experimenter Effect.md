The experimenter effect is a type of [[Bias|bias]], which may influence the results of a study. The experimenter effect occurs when the behavior or results of study participants are influenced by the experimenter's presence or behavior, rather than the independent variable being studied.
- The influence is typically unintended

The experimenter effect can either direct or more indirect:
***Indirect:***
An experimenter may unintentionally communicate their expectations to the study participants through subtle cues such as body language, tone of voice, or facial expressions. 

***Direct:***
For example, if an experimenter provides extra instructions or feedback to participants in one condition but not in another, this can affect the behavior or performance of participants and ultimately affect the outcome of the study.


#### Ways to Counter Act Experimenter Effect
- Keep experimenter blind to hypothesis
- Automate as much of the experiment as possible:
	- Standardized protocol
	- Computer that leads participants through experiment
	- Automated recording of variable values
