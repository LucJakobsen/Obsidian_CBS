Goodness of fit is a statistical concept that refers to the degree to which an observed data set matches the expected data set. In other words, it is a measure of how well a model or theory fits the observed data.

Goodness of Fit in many ways relate to the [[Validity]] of a model.


Goodness of fit is often assessed using statistical tests that compare the observed data with the expected data. For example, the [[Chi-squared Test|chi-squared test]] is a commonly used goodness of fit test.

***NOTE:*** Typically, multiple models will be used to determine the goodness of fit, such as the [[Chi-squared Test|chi-squared test]], [[Comparative Fit Index (CFI)]], the [[Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI)]], and the [[Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)]].
