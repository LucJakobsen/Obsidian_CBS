In the context of [[Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)]], a loading is a measure of the strength of the relationship between an observed variable/data (e.g., an [[Items|item]]) and a [[Construct|construct]]. 


Loadings can range from -1.0 to 1.0, with higher values indicating a stronger relationship between the variable/data and the construct.

High loadings on a construct typically refer to situations where the observed variables/data is strongly related to the construct being [[Measurement|measured]].


Loadings are also known as pattern coefficients. 
- NOTE: Usually a good idea to use standardized coefficients, easier to read


#### Cross Loading
If an observed variable/data loads on more than one construct, this is known as cross-loading.
- Means that the item is measuring more than one construct, and that it is not a good indicator of the intended construct
