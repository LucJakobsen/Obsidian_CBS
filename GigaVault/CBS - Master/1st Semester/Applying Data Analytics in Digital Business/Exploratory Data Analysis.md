Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing and understanding data in order to identify patterns, relationships, and potential outliers or anomalies.
- So it's basically when we look at the data and see what's going on

EDA is an iterative process, so you develope hypothesis, questions, etc. multiple times during the process.

A key part of exploratory data analysis is [[Data Cleaning]] (aka Data Wrangling)

#### EDA Techniques:
1. Data visualization: EDA often involves creating visual representations of the data, such as scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots, to identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers.
    
2.  Descriptive statistics: EDA may also involve computing summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to gain insight into the central tendencies and variability of the data.
    
3.  Data transformation: EDA may involve transforming the data in various ways, such as scaling, normalizing, or log-transforming, to better reveal patterns or relationships.
    
4.  Hypothesis generation: EDA may generate hypotheses about the relationships between variables or potential factors that influence the data, which can then be tested using formal statistical analyses.
    
5.  Missing data analysis: EDA may involve examining patterns of missing data, imputing missing values, and assessing the impact of missing data on the analysis.
