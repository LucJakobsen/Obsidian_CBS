Measurement level (levels of measurement), is the term used to describe the set of different data quality levels.

These levels are *nominal, ordinal, interval,* and *ratio*. With nominal data being the lowest quality, and ratio data the highest quality.

-   Nominal data = unordered groups or categories
-   Ordinal data = ordered groups or categories
	-   Distance between cannot be determined
-   Interval data = continuous values with no zero point
	-   Distance between is equal
-   Ratio data = continuous values with a zero point
