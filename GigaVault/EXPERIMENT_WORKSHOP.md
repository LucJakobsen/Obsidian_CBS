Your firm is interested in answering 3 main questions:  
• Is the drug effective in decreasing the systolic blood pressure?  
• Is the effectiveness of the drug affected by a pain medication that is  
commonly prescribed to elderly?  
• Is the effectiveness of drug dependent on the gender of the participant?  


##### How would you design the experiment to be able to answer the above  questions?
- Population is elderly --> ensure sample is somewhat representative (only recruit e.g. people over 65)
- Lab experiment
	- Testing drugs would benefit from a controlled environment where it's easier to account for extraneous variables
	- Easier to measure/observe the variables and their effect
- Between-subject Experiment
	- Treatment group which receives the drug vs. control group that receives a placebo
	- Randomization to reduce bias (in terms of the participants in which group)
		- If the pain medication is given this should also be random between the groups
