***Data do not understand causes and effects; humans do.***

### Introduction
The first section of the book introduces the science of "[[Causal Inference]]". 

It basically talks about the understanding behind cause and effect, and goes a bit back in time to explain how understanding what causes something and that changing the cause will alter the result has been the backbone of science and human progression. 

It also tells us how there has not really been a mathematical language for causation for quite a while in statistics (it basically used to be prohibited), but it's important to have so we can answer questions of ***why*** something happens - something which data by itself can't. 

It's basically about being able to isolate the [[Dependent Variable]] from [[Extraneous Variable|confounding and extraneous variables]]. 

We want to predict effects of an intervention (treatment) without enacting it.

Also says some stuff about [[Counterfactual Reasoning]] - dealing with "what ifs"

In essence, what makes humans so great and able to push forward in science is that we can ask the "what ifs" and try to answer them. AI e.g. can't do this unless it has data to back it up or data to which what ifs could happen (I think?)
- If we want AI to do this we need to give them a causal model
