The Ladder of Causality is a concept 

A causal learner must master at least three distinct levels of cognitive ability: 
1. seeing
	- detection of regularities in our environment
		- E.g. noticing fire is hot and hot = dangerous
2. doing
	- predicting the effect(s) of deliberate alterations of the environment and choosing among these alterations to produce a desired outcome
		- I.e. knowing or guessing what will happen if you change something in the environment and choosing between these outcomes to get what you want
			- E.g. I can take different pills to cure my headache, but I think this will work best to remove it
3.  imagining
	- being able to imagine why something works and what would happen if it didn't etc.

These levels are the three steps of the 'Ladder of Causality'

The first part of the ladder is the bread and butter of statistics. We get answers here from collected data and typically deal with [[Conditional Probability]].
