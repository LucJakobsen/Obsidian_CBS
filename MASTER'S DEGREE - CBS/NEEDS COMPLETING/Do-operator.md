The operator is basically specifying that we are examining the causal effect ([[Causation]]), rather than [[Correlation]]. 

The do-operator is related to and used when we perform interventions in [[Structural Causal Models]]. 

The do-operator gives us scientifically sound ways of determining causal effects from nonexperimental studies
- which challenge the traditional supremacy of [[Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)]].


Randomization has the same effect as the do-operator. So does statistical adjustment, if we pick the right variables to adjust.
