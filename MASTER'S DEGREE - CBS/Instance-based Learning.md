**Instance-based learning** (also called **memory-based learning**) means that our algorithm does not explicitly learn a model. Instead, it chooses to memorize the training instances which are subsequently used as `knowledge` for the prediction phase. 

So this means that only when a query to our database is made, will the algorithm use the training instances to spit out an answer.
