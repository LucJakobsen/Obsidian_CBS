Consumer [[Bias|biases]] are the unconscious influences on buying behavior that can lead to irrational, suboptimal, or prejudiced decision-making. These biases are rooted in psychological principles and can stem from personal experiences, beliefs, or cognitive shortcuts ([[heuristics]]). Some common consumer biases include:
1. **Brand Loyalty Bias**: Preferring a brand due to familiarity or positive past experiences, sometimes to the exclusion of objectively better alternatives.
    
2. **[[Anchoring Effect]]Anchoring Bias**: Relying too heavily on the first piece of information (the "anchor") received when making decisions, such as the initial price of a product affecting perceptions of subsequent prices.
    
3. **[[Confirmation Bias]]**: Seeking out information that confirms pre-existing beliefs or initial impressions while ignoring contradictory information.
    
4. **Loss Aversion**: Being more motivated to avoid losses than to acquire equivalent gains, which can affect risk assessment in purchasing decisions.
    
5. **Status Quo Bias**: Preferring products or services that maintain the current situation, avoiding change even when it might lead to better outcomes.
    
6. **Bandwagon Effect**: Buying a product because it seems popular or because others are doing so, not because of the productâ€™s intrinsic value.
    
7. **Choice Overload**: Struggling to make a decision when faced with too many options, which can lead to decision fatigue or avoidance of choice.

## In and Out Group Theory
In general, consumer biases rely broadly on "in and out group theory". 
- A key theory in in and out group theory is the [[Social Identity Theory]]
- Overarching theory is the [[Similarity-Attraction Theory]]
