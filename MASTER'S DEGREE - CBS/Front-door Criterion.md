The front-door criterion requires that Z transmits the entire effect of X on Y ([[Mediators|mediates]] the effect)

#### Three conditions for the front-door criterion:
1. Z intercepts all directed paths from X to Y 
2. There is no unblocked path from X to Z 
3. All backdoor paths from Z to Y are blocked by X


The front-door criterion helps solve the identification problem ([[Structural Causal Models]]).
