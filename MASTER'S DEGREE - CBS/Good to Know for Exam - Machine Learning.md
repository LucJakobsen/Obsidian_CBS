- Check distribution before choosing algorithms/models for prediction
- 

- Start with descriptive statistics
- Check different scatter plots to choose best fitting for linear regression
	- Calculate correlation coefficient to help decide
- The random seed from canvas should be put in the random_state for [[train_test_split]]

- Use ``df.isnull()`` to check for missing values
	- ``df.isnull().sum()`` will provide an overview of the various columnsÂ´ missing data

- For [[Logistic Regression (Python)]] we typically benchmark with random guess (50%)
