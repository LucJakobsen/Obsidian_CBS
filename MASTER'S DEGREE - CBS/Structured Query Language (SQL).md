Structured Query Language (SQL) is the language to communicate with RDBMS ([[Relational Databases]]) to perform operations. Generally there are two kind of operations:
1. [[Data Definition Language (DDL)]]
2. [[Data Manipulation Language (DML)]]

### Quick Overview of SQL
1. **Purpose**: SQL is used to communicate with a database. It allows users to access, modify, and manage data in a structured way.
    
2. **Main Operations**:
    - **SELECT**: Retrieve data from one or more tables.
    - **INSERT**: Add new data into tables.
    - **UPDATE**: Change existing data in tables.
    - **DELETE**: Remove data from tables.
    
3. **Advanced Features**:
    - **JOINS**: Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
    - **GROUP BY**: Group rows with the same values in specific columns.
    - **ORDER BY**: Sort the result set in ascending or descending order.
    - **WHERE**: Filter results based on a condition.
    
4. **DDL and DML**:
    - SQL can be divided into two parts:
        - **Data Definition Language (DDL)**, which deals with database structures and schemas (e.g., creating and modifying tables). Commands include `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`.
        - **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**, which deals with data within the database (e.g., inserting or querying data). Commands include `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

5. **Universality**: Most relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and many others use SQL, though they may have proprietary extensions.
