Mental representations within the context of consumer behavior, relate to how consumers perceive, interpret, and decide upon products or services based on both aware and unaware thought processes. In this way it also relates to [[Consumer Images]]. 

We typically look at these three:
1. **Rational Mental Representations**
	Rational representations involve conscious thought, where they basically perform cost-benefit analysis and comparisons to choose the best product. The process is guided by knowledge and factual information. 

2. **Conscious Mental Representations**: 
	The mental activities of which consumers are aware and can control. So they encompass rational decision-making but also the perceptions, feelings, and thoughts that consumers recognize and can articulate about a product or brand. So its when they can express preferences, needs, and desires that influence their buying behavior.

3. **Subconscious Mental Representations**: 
	The underlying mental processes that influence consumer behavior without their full awareness. They include deep-seated beliefs, values, emotions, and motives that can drive preferences and choices in ways consumers might not fully understand. They are typically automatic and can be triggered by marketing stimuli, brand associations, etc.


### Mental Representation & Attitudes
Mental representations can also be described as our attitudes towards certain things. In this way they are essentially the same. They therefore also relate to decision-making as shown below:
