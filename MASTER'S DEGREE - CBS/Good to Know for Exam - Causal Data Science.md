- Changing/manipulating a variable is called "wiggling" it
- Holding a variable constant is called "conditioning on" it
	- When you condition on a variable you remove all arrows from/to it
- The "|" sign means "given that" and is used in [[Conditional Probability]]
- The "тлл" symbol means independent
- In Chains and Forks the paths are open. In Colliders the path is blocked
	- If we condition on B we block the paths in chains and forks. In colliders we open it
- Directed paths and causal paths mean the same
- To deal with confounding paths we condition on specific variables
	- Blocking the non-causal paths but leaving the casual paths intact
- Conditioning on descendants of colliders also open up the path
