- Data does not reside in one place - it comes from various sources / databases
	- Sometimes we also gather data from outside (if work is outsourced e.g.) (fetching an [[API]])
- We combine all the data from the various sources for insights

- Warehouse is missing in many cases!
	- We don't need to aggregate data as much anymore
