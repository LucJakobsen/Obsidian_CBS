Relational databases are a type of [[Databases]] that organizes data into structured tables with rows and columns.
- The relations between various tables are handled via what is known as [[DBMS Keys]].

Use tables to store data. The structure of these tables is defined by a schema.
	- Store most of the global data. Approximately 73% of total data according to TechRepublic.
	- Popular because of transaction handling.
	- Storage and retrieval are slower at cost of reliability.
	- Strongly typed and costly to change.


- For designing Relational Databases, see [[Relational Database Design]]

#### Why are Relational Database Management Systems Popular?
They are popular because the key transaction support ACID
- **Atomicity**
	- It's all or nothing. If something goes wrong during a data action, everything goes back to the way it was.
- **Consistency**: 
	- They make sure data stays correct and follows the rules both before and after any action.
- **Isolation**: 
	- Many things can happen at the same time without mixing up
		- I.e. when multiple operations (like saving or changing data) are happening at the same time in the database, each operation is kept separate from the others
	- Ensures operations don't interfere with each other
- **Durability**: 
	- Once you save something, it stays saved, even if there's a problem later on.
	- So if the system fails, it will still go back to the last save where all was good

Relational databases can be either [[Operational Databases]] or [[Analytical Databases]].
- Typically we transform the operational database into an analytical, which will be suited for our analysis without affecting the stored operational data directly
	- The analytical database also has less "requirements" to follow/adhere to

- The logical modeling part is where the relations are specified between the data entries

### Interacting with Relational Database Management Systems
To interact with relational database management systems we use [[Structured Query Language (SQL)]]

### Relational Database Principles
- Every row of data must have a unique identified (primary key), so that the specific row can be distinguished from others with similar data

Typically we want to split the database into various, relevant tables:

When we know the primary keys we can also "anonoymize" the data more and have other benefits by using ID's

To better understand the relationships between the entities in relational databases, we utilize [[ER Models (Entity Relation Design)]]. 


### Data Abstraction in Relational Databases
- Physical level: describes how a record (e.g., instructor) is stored.
- Logical level: describes data stored in database, and the relationships among the data. 
	type instructor = record 
		ID : string; 
		name : string; 
		dept_name : string; 
		salary : integer;

- View level: application programs hide details of data types. Views can also hide information (such as an employeeâ€™s salary) for security purposes.

So, in simpler terms:
- **Physical level**: How the data is stored on the computer.
- **Logical level**: What data is there and how it's organized.
- **View level**: How specific users or apps see the data, with unnecessary details hidden.
