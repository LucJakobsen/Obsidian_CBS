Non-parametric tests and models are methods of statistical analysis that do not require assumptions about the distribution of the data to be analyzed.
- So e.g. there is no assumption that the data is normally distributed

It means it makes no explicit assumptions about the functional form, avoiding the dangers of mismodeling the underlying distribution of the data. 

**Example:**
Suppose our data is highly non-Gaussian (not normally distributed) but the learning model we choose assumes a Gaussian (normal) form. In that case, our algorithm would make extremely poor predictions.


Non-parametric models are more flexible, but often computationally intractable for large datasets.
