- ``round()`` = will round the input value to a specified number of places to the nearest integer

- ``divmod(x,y)`` = outputs the quotient and the remainder in a [[Tuples (Python)]] in the format (quotient, remainder)

- ``isinstance()`` = returns True, if the first argument is an instance of that class. Can be used to check the datatype. Multiple classes can be checked at once
	- E.g. ``isinstance(1, int)`` will check if 1 is an integer

- ``pow(x,y,z)`` can be used to find the power of x^y also the mod of the resulting value with the third specified number can be found i.e. (x^y%z)

- ``lambda`` = a lambda function is a special type of function without the function name
