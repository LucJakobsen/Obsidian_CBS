Typically we perform linear [[Regression]] to predict which [[Independent Variable]]s have the strongest association with the [[Dependent Variable]]. 

In general there are three ways of using linear regression models:
- To summarise data
- To predict the future
- To predict the results of interventions


Before we can perform linear regression in Python for prediction, we first have to split the data into a training set and a test set via a [[train_test_split]]. 


In Python and [[Machine Learning]], [[Multicollinearity]] does not invalidate your model's predictive performance. 


Another way to perform linear regression is through [[Regularized Linear Regression]] which helps avoid [[Overfitting]]. 

Also, another way of linear regression is [[Polynomial Regression]].
