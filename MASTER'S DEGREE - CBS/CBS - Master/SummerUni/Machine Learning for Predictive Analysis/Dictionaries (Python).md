Dictionaries are a type of [[Data Structures (Python)|data structure]] which contain a list of definitions that correspond to unique terms.

Dictionaries are unordered.


Creating a dictionary is done using curly brackets ``{}``

Similarly to [[Lists (Python)]] you can use square brackets to access elements/values in a dictionary ``[]``
