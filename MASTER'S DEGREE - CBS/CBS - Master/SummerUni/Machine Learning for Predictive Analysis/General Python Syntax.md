### Indentation
Indentation remains important in Python as its used to indicate the beginning of a code line. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code, e.g. when utilising [[Control Flow]]. 

#### Variable Naming
Two major requirements for variable naming:
- **Python requirements**
- **Style requirements**

1. Names must start with a letter (**Python requirement**) and should not begin with an underscore (**style requirement**)
2. Names are case sensitive but avoid distinguishing names only by case (**style requirement)
3. For variable names composed of multiple words separate each word by capitalizing the first letter of each word or by using an underscore (**style requirement**)
4. Can't be a [[Reserved Words|keyword]] (**Python requirement**)

### Denoting Strings
To denote strings in Python we use ""

To concatenate strings (add them together) is done using ``+``. Note that we need to add a space if we want a space between the strings


### Creating Formatted Output
Formatted output is created using the special operator ``%``
- ``%s`` = string
- ``%d`` = integer
- ``%f`` = float

### Adding line skips
Adding line skips is done using the (**IDK**) in the code.


### Declaring [[Functions (Python)|Functions]] in Python
A function in Python is defined using the ``def`` keyword, followed by a name, a signature within parentheses ``()``, and a colon ``:``

Indentation is used to define the body of the function.
