In black box models it is not quite clear and can be difficult to understand what goes on "within" the algorithm. Typically these models are more complex, such as [[Neural Networks]] or ensemble tree-based models, like [[Random Forests]]. 

In white box models it is clear what goes "within" the algorithm, and easy to understand how the decision-making process goes. Typically white box models are e.g. [[Decision Trees]].

[[Decision Trees]] are widely considered as white-box models because they provide clear and interpretable rules for decision-making. However, [[Ensemble Learning]] trees are not. They are black-box models because the combination of multiple trees makes it less interpretable than an individual decision tree.
