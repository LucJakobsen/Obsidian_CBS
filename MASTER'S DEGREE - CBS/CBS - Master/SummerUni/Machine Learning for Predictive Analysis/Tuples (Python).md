Tuples are a [[Data Structures (Python)|data structure]] similar to [[Lists (Python)|lists]], but the difference is the elements inside a list can be changed, in a tuple they can't.
- Therefore Tuples follow the same indexing and slicing as Lists.

To define a tuple, A variable is assigned to `paranthesis( )` or `tuple( )`.

**Example:**
``tup = ()
``tup2 = tuple()

If you want to directly declare a tuple it can be done by using a comma at the end of the data:
``27,`` which will result in ``(27,)``


### Built-in Tuple Functions
- ``count()`` = counts the number of specified element that is present in the tuple
- ``index()`` = returns the index of the specified element.
	- If the elements are more than one then the index of the first element of that specified element is returned
