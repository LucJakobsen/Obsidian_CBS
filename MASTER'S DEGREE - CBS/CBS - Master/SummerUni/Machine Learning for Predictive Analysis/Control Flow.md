Control flow is the basic decision-making process in programming, which determines how a computer program will respond when given certain conditions and parameters.

### Functions used in control flow:
- ``if`` statements ([[If statement]])
- ``else`` statements ([[Else statement]])
- ``elif`` statements ([[Elif statement]])
- ``for`` loops ([[For loop]])
- ``while`` loops ([[While loop]])
