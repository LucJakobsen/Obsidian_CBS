Machine Learning is a subset of [[Artificial Intelligence]]. It springs from the want of developing a machine that acts like a human being - leading to thinking about how humans learn (which we do from others etc.)

So machine learning is making and studying algorithms so machines can learn from data. 


#### Machine Learning applications in business
- Consumer segmentation and preference learning
- Product recommendation (recommender systems)
- User targeting in digital advertising
- Inventory pricing
- Credit card fraud detection
- Index tracking/portfolio replication


### Types of Machine Learning
- [[Reinforcement Learning]]
- [[Supervised Learning]]
- [[Unsupervised Learning]]


### Five Tribes of Machine Learning
The Five tribes are different areas people come from to add to machine learning
- Symbolists
- Connectionists
- Revolutionaries
- Bayesians
- Analogizers

Algorithms typically have unique characteristics that relate them to a tribe
