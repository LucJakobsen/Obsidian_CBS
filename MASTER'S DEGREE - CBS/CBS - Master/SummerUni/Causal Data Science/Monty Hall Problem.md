The Monty Hall is a famous probability puzzle named after the host of the television game show "Let's Make a Deal," Monty Hall and essentially goes as follows:

*"Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say #1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say #3, which has a goat. He says to you, ‘Do you want to pick door #2?’ Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?"*

The surprising answer is that you should switch your choice, since this is 2/3 to have the car.
- We have to take into account both the data (door we opened) and the process (that the host knows which door has the prize)

Monty could not open Door 1 after you chose it—but he could have opened Door 2. The fact that he did not makes it more likely that he opened Door 3 because he was forced to. Thus there is more evidence than before that the car is behind Door 2.

The Monty Hall Problem is related to [[Bayesian Analysis]]
