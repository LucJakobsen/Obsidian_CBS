The Turing Test is a test from 1950 by Alan Turing, who asked what it would mean for a computer to think like a human.

The test is basically: *a computer could be called a thinking machine if an ordinary human, communicating with the computer by typewriter, could not tell whether he was talking with a human or a computer*
