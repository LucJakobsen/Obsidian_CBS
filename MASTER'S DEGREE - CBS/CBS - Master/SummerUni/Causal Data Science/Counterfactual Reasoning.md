Counterfactuals are "what if" scenarios - i.e. [[Queries]] which deal with "what ifs"


Counterfactuals are the building blocks of moral behavior as well as scientific thought:
*The ability to reflect on oneâ€™s past actions and envision alternative scenarios is the basis of free will and social responsibility*

Counterfactuals are the top ladder of the [[Ladder of Causality]]. 


Counterfactuals have a particularly problematic relationship with data because data are, by definition, facts

### Benefits of Counterfactuals:
- If we can find answers to the counterfactuals we can take the right corrective measures in the future
- Allows us to learn from history and the experience of others
