Counterfactuals are "what if" scenarios - i.e. [[Queries]] which deal with "what ifs"
- We evaluate counterfactuals by comparing our world where and event didn't happen/happened, to the most similar world in which an event happened/didn't happen

Counterfactuals are the building blocks of moral behavior as well as scientific thought:
*The ability to reflect on oneâ€™s past actions and envision alternative scenarios is the basis of free will and social responsibility*

Counterfactuals are the top ladder of the [[Ladder of Causality]]. 


Counterfactuals have a particularly problematic relationship with data because data are, by definition, facts while counterfactuals are imagination

### Benefits of Counterfactuals:
- If we can find answers to the counterfactuals we can take the right corrective measures in the future
- Allows us to learn from history and the experience of others

### Answering Counterfactual [[Queries]]
Answering counterfactual queries are done using structural causal models. 
*With a fully specified [[Structural Causal Models]], entailing a causal diagram and all the functions behind it, we can answer any counterfactual query*

### Computing Counterfactuals (Individual-level)
1. Abduction: Use evidence E = e to determine the value of U.

2. Action: Modify the model M, by removing the structural equations for the variables in X and replacing them with the appropriate functions X = x, to obtain the modified model, Mx .

3. Prediction: Use the modified model, Mx , and the value of U to compute the value of Y , the consequence of the counterfactual
