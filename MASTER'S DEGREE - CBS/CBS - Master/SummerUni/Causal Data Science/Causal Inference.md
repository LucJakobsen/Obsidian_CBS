Casual inference is essentially predicting the effects of interventions in [[Structural Causal Models]]. 
- Which are essentially thought experiments ([[Experiment]]s which can't really be run in reality)

Causal inference requires a rich language in the form of diagrams - not just the numbers of probabilities etc.



Causal analysis allows us to quantify processes in the real world, not just patterns in the data
- It's not possible to perform purely data-driven causal inference
	- Some data-driven approaches exist, these are part of [[Causal Discovery]]

Causal analysis is emphatically not just about data; in causal analysis we must incorporate some understanding of the process that produces the data, and then we get something that was not in the data to begin with

Causal analysis requires the user to make a subjective commitment, so its not 100% objective like looking at data is.
