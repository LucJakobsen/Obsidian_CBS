Simpson's Paradox is a statistical phenomenon where a trend observed within separate groups reverses or disappears when the groups are combined.

It occurs when the groups being compared are significantly different from each other in some way. 
- This can lead to the spurious correlation that masks the actual underlying trend when groups are combined.

So essentially it shows how issues might arise from observational studies, compared to more controlled [[Experiment]]s such as [[Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)]]. 

**Example:**
Consider a situation where a drug is tested on two groups of patients, young and old, for effectiveness against a disease. 

The drug might appear to work better on young people in the young group and better on old people in the old group, but when you combine the data of the two groups, it might appear that the drug actually works worse overall.
