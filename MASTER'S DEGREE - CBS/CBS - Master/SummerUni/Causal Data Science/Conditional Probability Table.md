A CPT is a table that provides the probabilities of outcomes given a set of conditions or events. In this way it is related to [[Conditional Probability]]. 


**Example:**
In the case where the node A has a parent, A has to “listen” to its parent before deciding on its own state. We can show this “listening” process with a 2 × 2 table.

If Test “hears” that D = 0, then 88 percent of the time it will take the value T = 0, and 12 percent of the time it will take the value T = 1

The false positive rate (upper right corner) is 12 percent, and the sensitivity (lower right corner) is 73 percent. The remaining two entries are filled in to make each row sum to 100 percent
