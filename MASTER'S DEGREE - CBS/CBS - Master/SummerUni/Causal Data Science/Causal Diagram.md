Causal diagrams are graphic diagrams utilised to visualise and explain [[Causation]]. 

A causal diagram is a [[Bayesian Networks]] in which every arrow signifies a direct causal relation, or at least the possibility of one, in the direction of that arrow.
- To turn a causal diagram into a Bayesian network, we have to specify the [[Conditional Probability Table]]s. 

A convenient way of thinking about the causal model is in terms of hypothetical experiments. 
- Each arrow can be thought of as a statement about the outcome of a hypothetical experiment.

Examples could e.g. be [[Directed Acyclic Graphs]]. 


Whereas a [[Bayesian Networks]] can only tell us how likely one event is, given that we observed another (rung-one information, [[Ladder of Causality]]), causal diagrams can answer interventional and counterfactual questions.
