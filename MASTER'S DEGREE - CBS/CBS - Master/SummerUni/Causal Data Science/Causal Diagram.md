Causal diagrams are graphic diagrams utilised to visualise and explain [[Causation]] and used for [[Causal Inference]]. They are a model of how we *think* the world works and are essentially the same as [[Structural Causal Models]]. 
- We arrive at a model/diagram by using our knowledge about the particular context under study
	- e.g. through literature review, interviews, etc.




A causal diagram is a [[Bayesian Networks]] in which every arrow signifies a direct causal relation, or at least the possibility of one, in the direction of that arrow.
- To turn a causal diagram into a Bayesian network, we have to specify the [[Conditional Probability Table]]s. 

A convenient way of thinking about the causal model is in terms of hypothetical experiments. 
- Each arrow can be thought of as a statement about the outcome of a hypothetical experiment.

Examples could e.g. be [[Directed Acyclic Graphs]]. 

We call a model “completely specified” if the functions behind the arrows are known and “partially specified” otherwise

Whereas a [[Bayesian Networks]] can only tell us how likely one event is, given that we observed another (rung-one information, [[Ladder of Causality]]), causal diagrams can answer interventional and counterfactual questions.
