Hill's Criteria (aka viewpoints), are a set of factors that could be used to assess the strength of evidence for causality ([[Causation]]) in observational studies. 

These criteria, although not an absolute proof of causality, provided a framework for evaluating the association between smoking and lung cancer. The criteria are as follows:

1. Strength: A strong association between smoking and lung cancer suggests a causal relationship.
    
2. Consistency: The association should be consistently observed in different studies conducted by different researchers in different populations.
    
3. Specificity: The cause (smoking) should be specifically associated with the effect (lung cancer) rather than a wide range of unrelated outcomes.
    
4. Temporality: The cause (smoking) should precede the effect (lung cancer) in time.
    
5. Biological gradient: A dose-response relationship should exist, meaning that higher levels of exposure to the cause (smoking) should lead to a higher risk of the effect (lung cancer).
    
6. Plausibility: The causal relationship should be biologically plausible, based on known mechanisms or prior knowledge.
    
7. Coherence: The causal relationship should be consistent with existing knowledge and not contradict other established facts.
    
8. Experiment: Evidence from experimental studies, such as randomized controlled trials, can provide stronger support for causality.


#### Important to note:
*"Hillâ€™s criteria are best read as a historical document, summarizing the types of evidence that had emerged in the 1950s, and ultimately convinced the medical community. But as a guide to future research, they are inadequate"*
