In the context of statistics and causal inference, mediation is a process through which an [[Independent Variable]] (the cause) transmits its effects on the [[Dependent Variable]] (the effect) through an intermediary variable, known as the [[Mediators|mediator]].  

It requires a sensitive ability to tease apart [[Total Effects]], [[Direct Effects]] (which do not pass through a mediator), and [[Indirect Effects]] (which do)
- So it also relates to separating the [[Direct Effects]] from the [[Indirect Effects]]

**Example:**
Imagine you're studying the effects of education level on income, and you hypothesize that one of the ways education affects income is through job opportunities. In this case, job opportunities would be a mediator. This is because:

1. Education level (the independent variable) can influence job opportunities (the mediator).
2. Job opportunities can then influence income (the dependent variable).

So, in a mediation analysis, you would first investigate the relationship between education and job opportunities, and then investigate the relationship between job opportunities and income, controlling for education.
