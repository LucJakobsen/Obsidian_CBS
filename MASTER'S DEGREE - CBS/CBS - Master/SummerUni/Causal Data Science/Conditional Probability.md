Conditional Probability is the degree of association between two variables. 

So what is the probability of an event given another event has occurred.

Like the probability of  a customer who has bought toothpaste to also buy dental floss: 
***P(floss | toothpaste)***
- The “P” stands for “probability,” and the vertical line means “given that you see.”


In conditional probability you typically "[[Conditioning a Factor|condition a factor]]"/event for calculating the probabilities.
