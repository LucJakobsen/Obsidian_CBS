Inverse probability is when you deduce the probability of an effect from a cause. 

Intuition and common sense give us no clear guidance when dealing with inverse probability.

The opposite is [[Forward Probability]]. 

Inverse probability is solved through [[Bayes' Rule]], and is a key concept for [[Bayesian Networks]]. 
- Here's how: *we can estimate the conditional probability directly in one direction, for which our judgment is more reliable, and use mathematics to derive the conditional probability in the other direction, for which our judgment is rather hazy*


**Example:**
If we observe a cause—for example, Bobby throws a ball toward a window—most of us can predict the effect (the ball will probably break the window). Human cognition works in this direction. 

But given the effect (the window is broken), we need much more information to deduce the cause (which boy threw the ball that broke it or even the fact that it was broken by a ball in the first place).
