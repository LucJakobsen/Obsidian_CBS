Forward probability is when you deduce the probability of a cause from an effect. 

Typically we can intuition and common sense to help guide us in relation to forward probability.

Opposite is [[Inverse Probability]]. 


**Example:**
If we observe a cause—for example, Bobby throws a ball toward a window—most of us can predict the effect (the ball will probably break the window). Human cognition works in this direction. 

But given the effect (the window is broken), we need much more information to deduce the cause (which boy threw the ball that broke it or even the fact that it was broken by a ball in the first place).
