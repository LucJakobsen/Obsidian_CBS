In the context of [[Causal Inference]] and [[Do-calculus]] as formulated by Judea Pearl, the term "do" is used to denote an intervention. When we say "do(X)", we mean that we are intervening in the system to set the variable X to a certain value, irrespective of its previous state or inputs.

The do-operator is related to and used when we perform [[Interventions in Structural Causal Models]]. 


The do-operator gives us scientifically sound ways of determining causal effects from nonexperimental studies
- which challenge the traditional supremacy of [[Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)]].


Randomization has the same effect as the do-operator. So does statistical adjustment, if we pick the right variables to adjust.
