Berkson's Paradox is a statistical paradox which essentially stemming from observational studies, and essentially goes: *"even if two diseases have no relation to each other in the general population, they can appear to be associated among patients in a hospital"*.

Basically by performing a study on patients who are hospitalized, we are controlling for (only looking at) Hospitalization. As we know, conditioning on a collider creates a spurious association between Disease 1 and Disease 2 (see [[D-Separation]]).
