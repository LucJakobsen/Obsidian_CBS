The prototype of Bayesian analysis goes like this: Prior Belief + New Evidence --> Revised Belief



**Example:**
Suppose you toss a coin ten times and find that in nine of those tosses the coin came up heads
- Your belief that the coin is fair is probably shaken, but how much?

A Bayesian statistician, would say, “Wait a minute. We also need to take into account our prior knowledge about the coin.” Did it come from the neighborhood grocery or a shady gambler? If it’s just an ordinary quarter, most of us would not let the coincidence of nine heads sway our belief so dramatically
