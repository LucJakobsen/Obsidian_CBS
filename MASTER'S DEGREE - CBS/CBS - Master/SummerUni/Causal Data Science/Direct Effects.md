The effect of a treatment variable X on an outcome variable Y that is not mediated by any other variable  
  - So changes in x directly causes a change in y

Consider the simplest case, which includes three variables: 
1. a treatment X, 
2. an outcome Y,
3. a mediator M. 
 
We get the direct effect of X on Y when we “wiggle” X without allowing M to change


### Controlled Direct Effects
The causal effect of a treatment (X) on an outcome (Y) when we condition on a mediator variable (M)
- The opposite of the controlled direct effect is the natural direct effect

### Natural Direct Effects
The expected change in the outcome (Y) if we were to change the treatment (X )from a benchmark/base level to another level,  while keeping the mediator M at the same level it would have been if we kept X at the benchmark/base level
