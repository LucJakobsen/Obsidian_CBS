The effect of a treatment variable X on an outcome variable Y that is mediated through another variable  
  - So the treatment affects a mediator, which then affects the outcome

Indirect effects, unlike [[Direct Effects]], have no “controlled” version because there is no way to disable the direct path by holding some variable constant.

[[Counterfactual Reasoning|Counterfactuals]] are needed to express [[Indirect Effects]]


### Natural Indirect Effects
The expected change in the outcome (Y) if we were to keep the treatment (X) fixed at a certain level, but change the mediator (M) from the what it would be under the benchmark/base level of X, to what it would be under a different level of X
