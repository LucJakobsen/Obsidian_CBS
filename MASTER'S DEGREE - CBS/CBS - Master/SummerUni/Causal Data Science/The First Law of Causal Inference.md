Yx (u) = YMx(u)

The first law says that the potential outcome Yx (u) can be imputed by going to the model Mx (with arrows into X deleted) and computing the outcome Y(u) there

So, in simpler terms, if you want to see what could happen to something (Y) when you do a certain action (X), you can figure it out by imagining a scenario where your action (X) isn't affected by anything else and then looking at what happens to that something (Y) in this scenario.
