## Causal Data Science for Business Decision-making
[[Book of Why Readings]]
#### Lecture 1
Lecture 1 focused on introducing the idea behind causal inference and causality, saying it remains important as it can change the results and interpretations we can gain from data: *There are no definite answers in causal inference --> it depends on the assumptions you have bring and have*
[[Causal Inference]]
[[Causation]]
[[Simpson's Paradox]]
[[Counterfactual Reasoning]]
[[Ladder of Causality]]

### Lecture 2
Lecture 2 focused on why causation is important and how it differs from [[Correlation]]. It then introduced us to the concept of causal models and explained how the idea of causation differs from equations. Finally, the idea behind d-separation was introduced.
[[Ladder of Causality]]
[[Structural Causal Models]]
[[Directed Acyclic Graphs]]
[[D-Separation]]

### Lecture 3
Lecture 3 introduced us to the program of Causalfusion.net, where we examined causal paths (aka directed paths) within causal models. A key point was that there can still be paths even when there is no causal path - these are confounding paths or biased paths.

### Lecture 4



## Machine Learning for Predictive Analytics in Business
#### Lecture 1
Lecture 1 introduced what machine learning is and how it can be used it business. Furthermore, it explained why Python was used and how to install it. Also had some general review of relevant mathematics.
[[Machine Learning]]


### Lecture 2
Lecture 2 introduced some basic Python syntax and showed how to handle data in Python. Furthermore, we were introduced to various data structures in Python, as well as various, useful libraries.
[[General Python Syntax]]
[[Python Operators]]
[[Data Structures (Python)]] + [[Data Collection in Python]]
[[Python Libraries]]

### Lecture 3
Lecture 3 focused on data visualization within Python by introducing various tools and libraries for descriptive analytics. 
[[Python Libraries]]
[[Descriptive Analytics (Python)]]

### Lecture 4
Lecture 4 introduced how to perform [[Regression]] within Python, more specifically the linear regression models such as [[OLS Regression]].
[[Linear Regression (Python)]]
[[Regularized Linear Regression]]
[[Polynomial Regression]]
[[train_test_split]]
[[K-fold Cross Validation]]

### Lecture 5
Lecture 5 introduced how to perform [[Logistic Regression]] in Python.
