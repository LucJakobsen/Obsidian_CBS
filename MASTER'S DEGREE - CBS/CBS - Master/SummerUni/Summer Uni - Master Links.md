[[Book of Why Readings]]
#### Lecture 1
Lecture 1 focused on introducing the idea behind causal inference and causality, saying it remains important as it can change the results and interpretations we can gain from data: *There are no definite answers in causal inference --> it depends on the assumptions you have bring and have*
[[Causal Inference]]
[[Causation]]
[[Simpson's Paradox]]
[[Counterfactual Reasoning]]
[[Ladder of Causality]]

### Lecture 2
Lecture 2 focused on why causation is important and how it differs from [[Correlation]]. It then introduced us to the concept of causal models and explained how the idea of causation differs from equations. Finally, the idea behind d-separation was introduced.
