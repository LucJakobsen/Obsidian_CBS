Domain encompasses a lot of different terminology - all basically about the same thing, but the terms have developed in accordance with time:
- **Information System (IS)** 
	- Computer-based technology that is used to perform some or all of its intended tasks. In may be one device or thousands of connected devices. Information systems may include: Hardware, Software, Databases, Networks, Procedures, and People  
- **Management Information Systems (MIS)**
	- Managing information systems, their design, construction, operation, use, and unintended consequences.  
- **Information Technology (IT)**
	- The technology that supports Information Systems  
- **Information and Communication Technology (ICT)**
	- The convergence of IT and communication networks
- **Digital Technology (DT)**
	- Computer-based products and services  

***Feel free to use any term, but use it consistently!***

To better understand the domain, we examine it through [[Information Systems Theory]]. 
## Three Building Blocks of the IS Domain

- It's not the building blocks but the interactions between them we are interested in
	- IS deals with the interplay between all three

For more information on the interplay between the blocks see:

### What are information systems about?
Original main concern:
- Design and management of business applications for information delivery supporting managerial decision making and value generation

Now:
- *"The effective use of Digital Technology to generate sustainable value and to drive change in behaviors and beliefs"

The definition is moving more from decision-making in organizations to in society at large
- Since everyone is using digital technologies
