Theory is a set of interrelated ideas or concepts explaining something based on general boundary assumptions and particular worldview.

They are devices or tools constructed by people to better understand the world - help other people with same worldview understand the world
- So theory doesn't just "come from nowhere"

Theories can be replaced as new knowledge is acquired or challenge the current worldview.

Theories and theorizing are about partial and focused perspectives - but can also use multiple perspectives
- So we look specific phenomenon from various perspectives to better understand it
#### KEY CRITERIA FOR A THEORY

## Two Key Characteristics for a Good Theory
1. Utility
	- Explanatory power
	- Face validity
2. Universality
	- Generalizable, Universal, Cross-disciplinary
	- Context independent, Abstract
	- Time independent, irreplaceable, irrefutable


### Why Theorize?
- Highlight points of interest (by filtering irrelevant )  
- Enhance accessibility (by reducing complexity)  
- Tool to facilitate...  
	- Reflection: drives a hermeneutic cycle
	- Sense-making: explain observed phenomena
	- Generalization: identify patterns or recurring processes
	- Testing: virtual or experimental based hypotheses testing
	- Brainstorming: Observation, analysis and design
	- Negotiation: Discussion-group process
	- Communication: Broadcast concepts and ideas

### Multiple Perspectives on Theory

- Each perspectives represent a "genre/class" of theories
	- They can all be used together to gain deeper understanding of a subject
