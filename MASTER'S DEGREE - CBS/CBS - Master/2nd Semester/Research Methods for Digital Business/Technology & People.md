This note explains the interplay and relationship between buildings blocks technology & people in the context of the [[Information Systems Domain]].


Today technology usually is connoted with computers, connectivity, information, data, etc.
- Hardcore computing and information technology
	-  This is quite new - as back in the day it was e.g. connoted with factories etc.

In the future, technology will connote with new things once again
- E.g. AI

### What is Technology?
*Technology connotes with people-made tools and techniques that can be used to perform specific functions*

So technology has three elements:
1. It is people made
2. It consists of tools, techniques, and methods
3. It performs specific functions (can also have multiple purposes)

### What are the Relationships?
The question of interest in our context is what is the relationship?
- I.e. what influences what - does technology influence people or vice versa or both

There are arguments for either, and more detail can be found via the theories:
1. [[Technological Determinism]]
2. [[Social Construction of Technology (SCOT)]]
3. [[Structuration Theory]]

So from these, we can say that technology and people have an ambivalent relationship. So highlight and focus on what you deem interesting!
