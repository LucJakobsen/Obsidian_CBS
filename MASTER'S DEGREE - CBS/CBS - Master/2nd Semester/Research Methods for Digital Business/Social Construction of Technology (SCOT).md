	- As opposed to the theory of [[Technological Determinism]]

In SCOT, people are given agency: "social construction shapes technology"


So technology is shapes through social processes related to adoption and use of technology
Technological innovation are shaped by socially relevant groups
- Users, regulators, competitors, patent holders, manufacturers, etc.
