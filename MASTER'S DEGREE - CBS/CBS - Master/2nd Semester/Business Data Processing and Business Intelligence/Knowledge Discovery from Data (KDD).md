Knowledge Discovery from Data (KDD) refers to the overall process of discovering useful knowledge from data.
- It encompasses the entire process of turning raw data into actionable insights, including preparation, selection, cleansing, and interpretation
- So in this way it very closely related to [[Data Mining]] and a part of [[Business Intelligence]]

### The KDD Process

1. Integrate the relevant, transactional data into a warehouse
	- All the data is aggregated in the warehouse based on different dimensions and facts (data isn't fetched on demand)
2. Data relevant for specific tasks is then extracted
	- E.g. looking at sales reports for a given region for a given year

	*NOTE*: Today warehouses are often missing/skipped because we are more efficient
	- So not always a need for aggregating data

3. Data is put together as per data mining and different pattern evaluations are applied to acquire knowledge from the patterns
