Business Intelligence (BI) refers to technologies, practices, and processes used to collect, analyze, and present business data.
- It is however more than just generating repots

The goal of business intelligence is to make business decision-making simple. 

*“Business intelligence (BI) is a broad category of applications, technologies, and processes for gathering, storing, accessing, and analyzing data to help business users make better decisions.”*

### Interchangeable Terms/Concepts of BI
- [[Data Mining]]
- [[Knowledge Discovery from Data (KDD)]]
- [[Business Analytics]]

### Business Intelligence vs. Business Analytics
Academic Camp:
- BA is an alternate term to BI.  
- BA is a subset of BI and focuses only on data analysis.  
- BA is advanced BI and handles advanced algorithms  
- It is all about knowledge discovery (classic BI)  
- Business Intelligence is [[Data Mining]] (classic BI)  

Industry Camp:
- Defines mechanism for BA  
- Focuses on functional categorization

So there are different views and perspectives on the two terms, but they are very similar. 
- Both terms are interchangeable

#### Big Steps in the Evolution of BI/BA
Changes in the fields have led three phases of evolution  
- BI & A 1.0 >> roots in database management fields 
	- (traditional database management system)
- BI & A 2.0 >> Web based data 
	- (started using Internet, lots of unstructured data available)
- BI & A 3.0 >> Censor based data 
	- (data generated from sensors, e.g. in the phone etc.)

So different fields emerged as new types of data occurred and came forth.
- Different data requires different techniques and applications!

## Concerns for [[Data]] Collection for BI
- Business data reporting process starts already at the data generation end.
- It is very common to expect a report where relevant data does not even exist. i.e. user behavior on an ICT platform.
- It is relatively much cheaper to collect more data from the beginning rather than changing systems afterwards
