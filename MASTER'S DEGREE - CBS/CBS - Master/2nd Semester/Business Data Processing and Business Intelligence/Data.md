### What is Data?
Data is *”information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making, or information in an electronic form that can be stored and used by a computer”*
	- Dictionary of Cambridge University

**According to Merriam-Webster:**
Data is:
1. factual information (as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation
2. information output by a sensing device or organ that includes both useful and irrelevant or redundant information and must be processed to be meaningful
3. information in numerical form that can be digitally transmitted or processed


- Data, without processing is not useful - it first becomes information when processed
- Data is a raw material for generating information.
- ”A means towards computational representation of real world phenomenon or event”
	- So it's a representation of something that happened
- It makes it relevant to think what data will be collected in any given scenario with respect to its context of usage.
	- So we need to understand the context before we can understand the data
