JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data format used for storing data that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. 
- It is a text format that is completely language-independent but uses conventions familiar to programmers of the C family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.
- JSON has less meta data than XML hence it is light weight

- The most widely accepted format for data exchange. 
	For example Web Apis, Configurations Node Js apps.
- It is a light weight data-interchange format.
- Text format and language independent.
	Structure consists of
	- A collection of name value pairs. Curly braces define boundary of an object.
	- An ordered list of values, Arrays.
	- Data types are defined through data formatting. 
		For example ”” mean string

JSON supports two primary data structures ([[Data Structures (SQL)]], [[Data Structures (Python)]]):
- A collection of key/value pairs, equivalent to [[Dictionaries (Python)]], maps, or hashes in most languages.
- An ordered list of values, equivalent to arrays, lists ([[Lists (Python)]]), or sequences in most languages.
