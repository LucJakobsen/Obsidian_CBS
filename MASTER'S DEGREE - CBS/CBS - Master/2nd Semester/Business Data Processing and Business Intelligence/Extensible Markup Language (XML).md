Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. 
- It is designed to store and transport data and to be both simple and extensible.

XML uses tags, similar to HTML, to denote different data structures

- Data is structured using tags.
- Tags form a Tree structure.
- Tags can also hold attributes
- Designer has choice to store data either as element (tags) or in attributes
