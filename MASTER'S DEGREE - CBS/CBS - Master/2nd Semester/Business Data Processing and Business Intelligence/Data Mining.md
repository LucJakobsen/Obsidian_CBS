Data mining is knowledge discovery from [[Data]]. So it's about extracting patterns from data and then presenting it for decision-making. 
- Extraction of interesting (non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful) patterns or knowledge from huge amount of data

- Data mining: a misnomer?  
	- We're actually looking for information in the data, not mining data
