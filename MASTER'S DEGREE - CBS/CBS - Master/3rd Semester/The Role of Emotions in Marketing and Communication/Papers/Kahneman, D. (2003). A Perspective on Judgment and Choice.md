Daniel Kahneman's paper, "A Perspective on Judgment and Choice: Mapping Bounded Rationality," explores how people make decisions and judgments under uncertainty. Kahneman discusses the dual-process theory of the mind ([[Dual Processes of the Mind]]), illustrating the interplay between fast, intuitive thinking (System 1) and slower, more deliberate thinking (System 2).

The paper delves into various biases and heuristics that affect our decisions, such as overconfidence, loss aversion, and the anchoring effect. Kahneman's work highlights the limitations of human rationality, proposing a model of bounded rationality where decisions are influenced by the ease of mental processing rather than by rational analysis alone.

## System Thinking
Daniel Kahneman's paper introduces a two-system view of cognitive processes, distinguishing between intuition (System 1) and reasoning (System 2)

- **System 1** is characterized as fast, automatic, effortless, associative, implicit (not available to introspection), and often emotionally charged. 
	- These operations are also governed by habit and are difficult to control or modify.
	- System 1 strives to produce a coherent picture of the world
		- Makes us prone to see patterns where there are none
- **System 2** involves slower, serial, effortful processes that are more likely to be consciously monitored and deliberately controlled. 
	- These operations are relatively flexible and potentially rule-governed.

System 1 retrieves data from memory. System 2 works on it but has no knowledge of, or control over the biasing influence of [[Anchoring Effect|anchors]]
