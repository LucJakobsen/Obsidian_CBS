The paper talks about that current consumer research focuses too much on conscious an deliberate choices made by the consumers (in terms of purchasing decisions). Bargh states that unconscious influences matter just as much.

He talks about [[Priming]] and how it is used to nonconciously influence consumers, and says it can happen in two ways:
 - **Subliminally** - where the priming isn't known by the consumer
- **Supraliminally** - where the consumer knows of the priming but not its potential influence

Supraliminally seems slightly more effective, and can e.g. be "goal activation" - which is to appeal to the goals the consumer already have. E.g. with health-related goals,  the person evaluates groceries in terms of health values, and this knowledge can be used in marketing.


1. **Integration of Social Cognition in Consumer Research**: The paper emphasizes the need to incorporate findings from social cognition, especially non-conscious influences, into consumer research.
    
2. **Automatic Influences on Consumer Behavior**: It highlights the significant role of automatic, nonconscious processes in shaping consumer judgments and decisions.
    
3. **Methodologies for Studying Nonconscious Processes**: The paper discusses various methods, like priming, used to study how nonconscious factors influence consumer behavior and motivation.
    
4. **Ethical and Practical Implications**: Bargh raises concerns about the ethical implications of using nonconscious processes in marketing and the practical applications in consumer behavior.
    
5. **Future Research Directions**: The paper concludes by suggesting future research paths, focusing on balancing the understanding of consumer influences with consumers' ability to resist unwanted influences.

#### 3 Main Insights:
The paper talks about that current consumer research focuses too much on conscious an deliberate choices made by the consumers (in terms of purchasing decisions). Bargh states that unconscious influences matter just as much. As such, the three main insights I have obtained from the paper are as follows:

1. **Non-concious** **Choice**: A large amount of consumer behaviour and their judgements are made without being fully deliberate or without conscious intent - as opposed to what former consumer research has indicated.
2. **Goals & Choices:** Personal goals and desires often influence our choice of products and our behaviour as consumers. E.g. having health-related goals will likely results in more purchases of products marketed as healthy / products with good health values.
3. **Priming & Ethics:** Nonconscious primes can be delivered either subliminally or supraliminally - and whether we are aware of the priming or not there are some ethical concerns to have regarding nonconcious influences, to which Bargh urges a more balanced approach in consumer research.
