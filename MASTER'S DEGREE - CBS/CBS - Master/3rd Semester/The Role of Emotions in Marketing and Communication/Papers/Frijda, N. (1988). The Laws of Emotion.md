The paper talks about how the research on [[Emotions]] (which used to be sort of lackluster), now has developed to such a degree that a set of specific laws pertaining emotions can be established. These laws of emotions are then put forth by Frijda, and are as follows:

- ***The Law of Situational Meaning***
- ***The Law of Concern***
- ***The Law of Apparent Reality***
- ***The Laws of Change, Habituation, and Comparative Feeling***
- ***The Law of Hedonic Asymmetry***
- ***The Law of Conservation of Emotional Momentum***
- ***The Law of Closure***
- ***The Law of Care for Consequence***
- ***The Laws of the Lightest Load and the Greatest Gain***


### The Law of Situational Meaning
That emotions arise as response to specific types of events. *"Input some event with its particular kind of meaning; out comes an emotion of a particular kind*. So e.g. in goes loss, out comes grief
- However it's not that simple, the personal significance of an event to the individual plays a large role

### The Law of Concern
Emotions are related to things that individuals care about, reflecting personal goals, motives, or concerns.
- Emotions are the prime material for explaining what a person is concerned about

### The Law of Apparent Reality
The intensity of emotions corresponds to the perceived realness of an event.
- Knowing means less that seeing, feeling means more than knowing

### The Laws of Change, Habituation, and Comparative Feeling
Emotions are often elicited by changes in circumstances rather than static conditions, with emotional responses adapting over time.

**Change**;
The greater the change, the greater the emotion

**Habituation**:
Continued pleasures wear off, continued hardships lose their poignancy

**Comparative Feeling**;
The intensity of emotion depends on the relationship between an event and some frame of reference

### The Law of Hedonic Asymmetry
There is an asymmetrical adaptation to pleasure and pain, with pleasure fading with continuous satisfaction while pain can persist under constant adverse conditions.
- We never get used to some miseries, while we get used to events that bring joy and delight

### The Law Conservation of Emotional Momentum
Emotional responses to events can retain their intensity indefinitely unless counteracted by specific factors such as habituation.
- What accounts for habituation is the repeated exposure to events that counteract the elicitation of these emotions
- Certain pains do not grow old, they just refer to old events

### The Law of Closure
Emotions tend to be self-contained and resistant to contradictory information, prioritizing their own goals and perspectives.
- The cause of an emotion may be relatively minor, while the emotional response is not
- Emotions know not probabilities, what they know they know for sure (e.g. when you are jealous you are certain the other person is e.g. cheating or whatever)

### The Law of Care for Consequence
Emotional impulses generate secondary impulses aimed at moderating the primary emotion in consideration of potential consequences.
- We rarely smash our truly precious objects in anger

### The Laws of the Lightest Load and the Greatest Gain
Emotional impulses generate secondary impulses aimed at moderating the primary emotion in consideration of potential consequences.
- We tend to view situations in ways that minimize negative emotional load and maximize emotional gain
- We complement reality with imagination and we detract from it by not thinking about particular implications
