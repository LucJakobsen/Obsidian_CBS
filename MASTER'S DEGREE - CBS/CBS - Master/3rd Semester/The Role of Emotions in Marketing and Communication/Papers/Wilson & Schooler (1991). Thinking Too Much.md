The paper "Thinking Too Much: Introspection Can Reduce the Quality of Preferences and Decisions" by Wilson and Schooler examines how excessive introspection and analysis of reasons for preferences can lead to poorer decision-making. 

Through experiments with strawberry jam tasting and course selections, the authors show that participants who overanalyzed their choices aligned less with expert opinions and made less optimal decisions. 

This work suggests that intuition may often lead to better outcomes than rigorous introspection, challenging traditional views on the benefits of deep reflection in decision-making.

- So basically it challenges a bit the view or idea that system 2 thinking from [[Dual Processes of the Mind]] by Kahneman ([[Kahneman, D. (2003). A Perspective on Judgment and Choice]]), will automatically lead to better decisions
