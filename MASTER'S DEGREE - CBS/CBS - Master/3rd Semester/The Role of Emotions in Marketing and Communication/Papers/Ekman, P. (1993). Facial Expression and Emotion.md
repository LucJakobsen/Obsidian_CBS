The paper looks into the connection between facial expressions and various emotions, stating that the research on facial expression has resulted in more knowledge on emotions (see his list in paper about what it has contributed). Ekman states that there are universal emotions with universal facial expressions - even across cultures (though their meaning might differ). 

Ekman says it is possible to show emotions without facial expression, and have facial expressions without feeling emotion. However overall, there is still much more to be understood about the connection between facial expressions and emotions differ in individuals etc.
