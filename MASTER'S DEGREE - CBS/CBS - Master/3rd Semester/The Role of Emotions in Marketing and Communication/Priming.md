Priming is a psychological concept where when something you see or hear quietly sets your brain up to react in a certain way without you realizing it.


**Example:** 
Someone who sees the word "yellow" will be faster to recognize the word "banana." This is because the concept of "yellow" primes related concepts in the brain, making them more accessible.
