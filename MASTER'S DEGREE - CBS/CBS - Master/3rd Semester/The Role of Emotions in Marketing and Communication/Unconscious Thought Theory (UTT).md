The Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT), as proposed by [[Dijksterhuis & Nordgren (2006). A Theory of Unconscious Thought]], posits that the unconscious mind is better at processing complex decisions than the conscious mind. 

According to UTT, when faced with complex decisions, allowing the unconscious to work—by diverting attention away from the problem—can lead to better outcomes than conscious deliberation. 

This is because the unconscious can process information in parallel, handling more variables and integrating them into an optimal decision without the working memory limitations faced by conscious thought.

- So basically it is saying that system 1 thinking can be better than system 2 thinking in many cases ([[Dual Processes of the Mind]])


## UTT Principles
1. **The Unconscious-Thought Principle**: Highlights the distinction between conscious and unconscious modes of thought, emphasizing their applicability under different circumstances.
    
2. **The Capacity Principle**: Points out the limitations of conscious thought due to its lower capacity compared to the vast capacity of unconscious thought.
    
3. **The Bottom-Up Versus Top-Down Principle**: Describes how unconscious thought processes information from the bottom-up, relying on raw data, whereas conscious thought works top-down, influenced by existing schemas and expectations.
    
4. **The Weighting Principle**: Suggests that unconscious thought naturally and effectively weights the importance of different decision attributes, while conscious thought may disrupt this natural weighting process.
    
5. **The Rule Principle**: Notes that conscious thought is better suited for tasks that require following strict rules or criteria, thanks to its precision and ability to focus, while unconscious thought provides rough estimates.
    
6. **The Convergence-Diversus-Divergence Principle**: Relates to creativity, positing that unconscious thought is more divergent, exploring a wider range of ideas, whereas conscious thought is convergent, focusing on specific solutions.
