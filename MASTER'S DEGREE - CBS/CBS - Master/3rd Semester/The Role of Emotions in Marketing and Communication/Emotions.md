Emotions are a complex psychological (but also physical) state which are deeply integrated into our brain's processing of experiences and decision-making. 

However, there is no clear definition of emotions, but can be seen as *responses to events that are important to us*


1. **Emotions as Physical States**: Damasio describes emotions as physical states arising from the body's responses to external stimuli. These states are part of a complex system involving both the body and the brain.
    
2. **Feelings as Mental Experiences**: Feelings are the mental experiences of these body states, which arise as the brain interprets emotions. This process allows us to be consciously aware of our emotional states.
    
3. **Purpose of Emotions**: Emotions have a functional purpose, aiming to make life more survivable by preparing us for various types of responses to our environment.
