Emotions are a complex psychological (but also physical) state which are deeply integrated into our brain's processing of experiences and decision-making. 
- Put differently, they are complex feelings that are elicited by a person, an object or an event.

However, there is no clear definition of emotions, but can be seen as *responses to events that are important to us*

1. **Emotions as Physical States**: Damasio describes emotions as physical states arising from the body's responses to external stimuli. These states are part of a complex system involving both the body and the brain.
    
2. **Feelings as Mental Experiences**: Feelings are the mental experiences of these body states, which arise as the brain interprets emotions. This process allows us to be consciously aware of our emotional states.
    
3. **Purpose of Emotions**: Emotions have a functional purpose, aiming to make life more survivable by preparing us for various types of responses to our environment.

Emotions can be of short or long duration but they do not usually last as long as moods, and they have direct implications for behavior

In both science and philosophy, cognitions (rational thinking) have historically dominated for hundreds of years. Emotions were criticised as being ‘irrational’, ‘distracting’ and ‘misleading’
