The universal [[Emotions]] are recognized across different cultures and are as follows: 
- anger
- fear
- sadness
- disgust
- contempt
- surprise
- enjoyment

These emotions are considered universal due to their expression and recognition being consistent across human societies, supported by cross-cultural research.

However, even though they are universal doesn't mean they are exhaustive.
