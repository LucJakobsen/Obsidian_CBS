Universal emotions or also called [[Basic Emotions]], are [[Emotions]] that were identified by prominent psychologist Paul Ekman as being recognized across different cultures.


Usually there is talk of 6 basic/universal emotions, but for the list below contempt has also been added: 
- anger
- fear
- sadness
- disgust
- contempt
- surprise
- enjoyment

These emotions are considered universal due to their expression and recognition being consistent across human societies, supported by cross-cultural research.

Ekman's research suggested that these basic emotions are recognized by people around the world, regardless of culture, indicating that the ability to express and interpret these emotions is a universal part of human nature.
- They are also often seen in the animal kingdom, which can serve as an argument for them being universal and basic
- They serve a functional purpose


However, even though they are universal doesn't mean they are exhaustive.
