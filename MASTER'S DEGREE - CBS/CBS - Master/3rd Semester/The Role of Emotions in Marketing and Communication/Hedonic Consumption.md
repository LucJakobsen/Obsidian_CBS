Hedonic consumption refers to the aspects of consumer behavior that are related to the sensory and emotional experience that comes from using products or services. 


It 's all about' the pursuit of pleasure, enjoyment, and aesthetic experiences, rather than the functional aspects. So it's more about a type of intrinsic joy and gratification provided by the consumption of the product.
