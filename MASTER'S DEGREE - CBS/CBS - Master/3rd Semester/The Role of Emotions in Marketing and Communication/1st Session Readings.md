### Bargh, J. (2002). Losing consciousness: automatic influences on consumer judgment, behavior, and motivation
The paper talks about that current consumer research focuses too much on conscious an deliberate choices made by the consumers (in terms of purchasing decisions). Bargh states that unconscious influences matter just as much.

He talks about priming and how it is used to nonconciously influence consumers, and says it can happen in two ways:
 - **Subliminally** - where the priming isn't known by the consumer
- **Supraliminally** - where the consumer knows of the priming but not its potential influence

Supraliminally seems slightly more effective, and can e.g. be "goal activation" - which is to appeal to the goals the consumer already have. E.g. with health-related goals,  the person evaluates groceries in terms of health values, and this knowledge can be used in marketing.


1.  **Consumer Research and Social Cognition**: The paper begins by noting that consumer research has not fully incorporated significant findings from social cognition research, particularly regarding non-conscious processes in judgment and behavior.
    
2. **Automatic and Nonconscious Influences**: Bargh emphasizes the importance of automatic or nonconscious influences on consumer choices and behavior, challenging the dominant view of conscious, deliberate decision-making in consumer research.
    
3. **Role of Nonconscious Processes**: The paper highlights the underplayed role of nonconscious processes in consumer behavior, compared to contemporary models in social psychology.
    
4. **Implications for Consumer Behavior**: Bargh discusses the implications of these nonconscious influences for consumer behavior, suggesting that much consumer decision-making occurs without conscious awareness or intent.
    
5. **Goal Pursuits and Cognitive Processes**: The paper also examines how social- and self-related goal pursuits moderate basic cognitive and reasoning processes, impacting consumer behavior.
    
6. **Real-World Applications**: There's a focus on applying these concepts in real-life consumer decisions and behaviors, assessing the extent of nonconscious influences in everyday functioning.
    
7. **Methodologies and Experimental Evidence**: The paper reviews methodologies for studying nonconscious processes, including priming techniques and their effects on behavior and motivation.
    
8. **Consumer Motivations**: Bargh advocates for expanding the study of consumer motivations beyond traditional models, incorporating a broader range of goals and needs.
    
9. **Ethical Considerations**: The paper touches upon the ethical implications of using knowledge about nonconscious processes in consumer research and marketing.
    
10. **Future Directions**: Finally, it suggests directions for future research in consumer behavior, emphasizing the need to balance the study of influencing consumer choices with understanding how consumers can defend against unwanted influences.



### Ekman, P. (1993). Facial expression and emotion
The paper looks into the connection between facial expressions and various emotions, stating that the research on facial expression has resulted in more knowledge on emotions (see his list in paper about what it has contributed). Ekman states that there are universal emotions with universal facial expressions - even across cultures (though their meaning might differ). 

Ekman says it is possible to show emotions without facial expression, and have facial expressions without feeling emotion. However overall, there is still much more to be understood about the connection between facial expressions and emotions differ in individuals etc.


1. **Facial Expressions Across Cultures**: Investigates how facial expressions are linked to emotions universally and within specific cultural contexts.
    
2. **Facial Action Coding System**: Describes the development and application of a system to categorize and measure facial expressions.
    
3. **Relationship Between Facial Expressions and Emotions**: Explores the connection between facial expressions and emotional states, challenging traditional psychological theories.
    
4. **Non-verbal Communication of Emotion**: Discusses the role of facial expressions in conveying emotions and intentions non-verbally.
    
5. **Directions for Future Research**: Suggests areas for further study in understanding facial expressions and their relation to emotional processes.
