## Bargh, J. (2002). Losing consciousness: automatic influences on consumer judgment, behavior, and motivation
The paper talks about that current consumer research focuses too much on conscious an deliberate choices made by the consumers (in terms of purchasing decisions). Bargh states that unconscious influences matter just as much.

He talks about priming and how it is used to nonconciously influence consumers, and says it can happen in two ways:
 - **Subliminally** - where the priming isn't known by the consumer
- **Supraliminally** - where the consumer knows of the priming but not its potential influence

Supraliminally seems slightly more effective, and can e.g. be "goal activation" - which is to appeal to the goals the consumer already have. E.g. with health-related goals,  the person evaluates groceries in terms of health values, and this knowledge can be used in marketing.


1. **Integration of Social Cognition in Consumer Research**: The paper emphasizes the need to incorporate findings from social cognition, especially non-conscious influences, into consumer research.
    
2. **Automatic Influences on Consumer Behavior**: It highlights the significant role of automatic, nonconscious processes in shaping consumer judgments and decisions.
    
3. **Methodologies for Studying Nonconscious Processes**: The paper discusses various methods, like priming, used to study how nonconscious factors influence consumer behavior and motivation.
    
4. **Ethical and Practical Implications**: Bargh raises concerns about the ethical implications of using nonconscious processes in marketing and the practical applications in consumer behavior.
    
5. **Future Research Directions**: The paper concludes by suggesting future research paths, focusing on balancing the understanding of consumer influences with consumers' ability to resist unwanted influences.

#### 3 Main Insights:
The paper talks about that current consumer research focuses too much on conscious an deliberate choices made by the consumers (in terms of purchasing decisions). Bargh states that unconscious influences matter just as much. As such, the three main insights I have obtained from the paper are as follows:

1. **Non-concious** **Choice**: A large amount of consumer behaviour and their judgements are made without being fully deliberate or without conscious intent - as opposed to what former consumer research has indicated.
2. **Goals & Choices:** Personal goals and desires often influence our choice of products and our behaviour as consumers. E.g. having health-related goals will likely results in more purchases of products marketed as healthy / products with good health values.
3. **Priming & Ethics:** Nonconscious primes can be delivered either subliminally or supraliminally - and whether we are aware of the priming or not there are some ethical concerns to have regarding nonconcious influences, to which Bargh urges a more balanced approach in consumer research.

## Ekman, P. (1993). Facial expression and emotion
The paper looks into the connection between facial expressions and various emotions, stating that the research on facial expression has resulted in more knowledge on emotions (see his list in paper about what it has contributed). Ekman states that there are universal emotions with universal facial expressions - even across cultures (though their meaning might differ). 

Ekman says it is possible to show emotions without facial expression, and have facial expressions without feeling emotion. However overall, there is still much more to be understood about the connection between facial expressions and emotions differ in individuals etc.


1. **Facial Expressions Across Cultures**: Investigates how facial expressions are linked to emotions universally and within specific cultural contexts.
    
2. **Facial Action Coding System**: Describes the development and application of a system to categorize and measure facial expressions.
    
3. **Relationship Between Facial Expressions and Emotions**: Explores the connection between facial expressions and emotional states, challenging traditional psychological theories.
    
4. **Non-verbal Communication of Emotion**: Discusses the role of facial expressions in conveying emotions and intentions non-verbally.
    
5. **Directions for Future Research**: Suggests areas for further study in understanding facial expressions and their relation to emotional processes.

## Hirschman, E. and Holbrook, M. (1982). Hedonic consumption: Emerging methods, concepts and propositions
The paper looks into what hedonic consumption is - which essentially is consuming goods/experiences for "pleasure" - but also more specifically defines it. It talks about how hedonic consumption differs from traditional consumer research and highlights how emotional desires influence product choice etc. and how these desires and such might differ across people and product classes.

1. **Definition of Hedonic Consumption**: It defines hedonic consumption as consumer behavior related to the multi-sensory, fantasy, and emotive aspects of product usage.
    
2. **Theoretical Background**: The paper discusses the theoretical origins and development of the concept of hedonic consumption within various behavioral sciences.
    
3. **Mental Constructs**: It compares traditional and hedonic approaches to consumer research, emphasizing emotional and imaginative aspects of consumer behavior.
    
4. **Hedonic Consumption Propositions**: The paper proposes several ideas about how emotional desires influence product choice and how consumers imbue products with subjective meaning.
    
5. **Individual Differences and Product Classes**: It examines how individual differences, such as ethnic background and social class, affect emotional and imaginative responses to products.

#### 3 Main Insights:
The paper defines 'Hedonic Consumption', which is the behaviour of consumers that relate to the multisensory, fantasy and emotional aspects of using/consuming products. As such, the three main insights I have obtained from the paper are as follows:

1. **Imagination & Desires for Product Choice:** Consumers will often imagine the product or themselves (with the product) in a certain way that will correlate to their emotional desires. They can thereby imagine a self-created reality where the product successfully fulfills said desire and lets them outlive the mental image. 
2. **Product Classes & Emotional Involvement:** Though all types of products seemingly can be experienced hedonically, different product categories vary in their emotional involvement from the consumer. E.g. there's likely stronger emotional involvement going to a concert or movie than using toothpaste at home.
3. **Cultural and Social Influences:** The emotional desires, fantasies, etc. that inspire the consumer vary from individual to individual, as their perceptions about products and product usage is influenced by ethnic background, social class, gender, culture, etc.
