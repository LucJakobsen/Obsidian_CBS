Behavioral ecology is a field of biology (and is also related to [[Evolutionary Psychology]]) that studies the evolutionary basis for animal behavior due to ecological pressures. 
- It explores how animals' behavior contributes to their survival and reproductive success in their natural environment.

### The Effects of Biased Sex Ratios  
The operational sex ratio (i.e., the ratio of reproductive-age females to males in a population) shapes both animal and human behavior in important ways.  

A male-skewed sex ratio increases the competition for female mating partners, resulting in various ecological plasticities:  
- Inter-male aggression and crime increases (Hudson and Den Boer 2002)  
- Men‘s (but not women‘s) rationalization and intent of sex tourism increases (Kock et al. 2020).  
- Men‘s porn consumption increases (ongoing work)  
- Men increase their spending behaviors for objects that display their wealth (Griskevicius et al., 2012).  
- Lower divorce rates and higher paternal investment (Marlowe 1999)  
- Men become more sexually restricted (Moss and Maner 2016)
