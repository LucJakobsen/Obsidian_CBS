People become richer and richer. But they don’t become happier (Dunn et al.  
2011).  
- The American buying-power has tripled since the 1950’s. But the proportion of  
Americans who described themselves as ‘very happy’ remained at around 33%  
(Myers and Diener 1995).

One answer may be found in how money has diminishing returns for reducing negative emotions as shown below:

### "Can't Buy Happiness"
Another answer to this question is that the things that bring happiness simply aren't for  
sale.  
- This sentiment is lovely, popular, and almost certainly wrong.  

Money allows people to.... (Smith, Langa, Kabeto, & Ubel, 2005):  
- live longer  
- have better nutrition and better medical care  
- have more free time  
- have more meaningful labor  
- buffer themselves against worry and harm  
- have leisure time to spend with friends and family  
- control the nature of their daily activities  

One reason for why the relationship between money and happiness is surprisingly weak  
may be the way people spend it.  
- If money doesn't make you happy, then you probably aren't spending it right.  

Money is an opportunity for happiness (and not happiness itself), but it is an opportunity that people routinely squander because the things they think will make them happy often don't!


In this way, [[Money & Happiness]] also relate closely to [[Materialism & Well-being]]
