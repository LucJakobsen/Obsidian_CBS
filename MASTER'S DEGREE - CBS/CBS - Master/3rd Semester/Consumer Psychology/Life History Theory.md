 Life history theory is a branch of evolutionary biology (and is related to [[Behavioral Ecology]]) that examines how organisms allocate resources to growth, reproduction, and survival. 
- According to life history theory, organisms face trade-offs when it comes to allocating energy and resources.

Each animal faces the problem of how to allocate its finite resources (e.g., energy) to survive and reproduce. Higher population densities increase competition for territory and resources  

A “slower” (as opposed to “faster”) life history strategies is adopted:  
- Greater investment of energy into growth and bodily maintenance  
- Delayed reproduction but increased effort into accumulating competitive ability and “embodied capital” (e.g., skills and knowledge)  
- Fewer offspring but greater investment in each individual offspring  

People in countries with higher population densities do exhibit a range of traits corresponding to a 
slower life history strategy: 
- They plan more for the future, are more oriented toward long-term romantic relationships, have children later, have fewer children, and invest more in their children’s education (Sng, Neuberg, Varnum, & Kenrick, 2017).
