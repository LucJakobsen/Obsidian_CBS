Incidental emotions are [[Emotions]] that are not directly related to the decision at hand but can still influence the decision-making process. These emotions arise from unrelated events or  circumstances but carry over and affect how a person thinks and feels about unrelated choices and judgments
- They very common and typically occurs without awareness.


**Examples:**
- Stock prices are positively correlated with good weather because good weather increases upbeat mood which results in more optimistic expectations about stocks (Hirshleifer and Shumway 2003).  
- Stock prices declined when a countryâ€™s soccer team was eliminated from the World Cup (Edmans et al. 2007).  
- Incidental excitement (e.g., after a roller-coaster ride) make people more attracted to good-looking individuals of the opposite sex (e.g., White, Fishbein and Rutsein, 1981).


#### Different emotions and moods also prompt people to make different decisions:  
- Sad individuals attribute events to situational factors (e.g., I missed the flight because the traffic was bad)
- But angry individuals attribute the same events to human factors (e.g., I missed the flight because the cab driver was terrible) (Keltner et al. 1993).  
	- This is because anger is typically caused by the actions of people and sadness by factors that are situational ([[Appraisal Theories]]).  
- People in positive mood take more risk 
- People in bad mood are more risk-averse.  
- People in positive mood use more [[Heuristics]] 
- People in bad mood use systematic processing more often (Maheswaran et al. 2006)


For this reason, we also see marketers try to influence emotions through e.g. [[Sensory Marketing]]
