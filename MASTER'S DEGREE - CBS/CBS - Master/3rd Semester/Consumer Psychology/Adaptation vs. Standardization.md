Adaptation vs. standardization in international marketing refers to the strategic decision between customizing products, services, and marketing strategies to fit the specific needs and preferences of local markets (adaptation) versus offering a uniform product and marketing approach across different markets (standardization).
- In this way it is related to [[Culture]] and [[International Consumer Psychology]]

Adaptation and Standardization are not mutually exclusive but exist as a continuum.  
Possible dimensions of adaptation and standardization: 
- Brand Design  
- Product offerings  
- Packaging size  
- Flavors/Varieties  
- Communication

### **Adaptation**:
- Tailors products, marketing campaigns, and business strategies to local cultures, tastes, and behaviors.
- Recognizes and responds to differences in consumer behavior, legal and regulatory environments, and competitive landscapes across countries.
- Aims to meet the unique demands of each market, potentially leading to increased customer satisfaction and market share within those markets.

### **Standardization**:
- Offers the same products and uses the same marketing strategies in all markets, regardless of local differences.
- Capitalizes on economies of scale, creating cost efficiencies in production and marketing.
- Promotes a consistent brand image and identity worldwide, which can be especially powerful for global brands.

### Local Products & Global Products
- Local products and brands are tailored for local markets and are marketed and distributed only in the consumerâ€™s home country.  

- Global products are tailored for global markets and marketed and distributed in many countries around the world marketed in multiple areas around the world in a centrally coordinated, near-standardized fashion (Steenkamp, Batra, and Alden 2003).
