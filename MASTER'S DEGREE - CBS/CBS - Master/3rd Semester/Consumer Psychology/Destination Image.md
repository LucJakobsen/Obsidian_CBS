Destination images are essentially [[Mental Representations]] we have about a specific destination.
- So they relate to the perceptions and ideas that potential tourists have about a destination, which can include cities, regions, or countries as travel destinations.


Important is also the idea of **Destination Imagery**, which is *"an individual’s or a group of  
individuals’ diverse cognitive and affective associations relating to a destination"*

As well as the idea of **Destination Affect**: *an individual’s overall affect attributed to a destination*
