Attaining Status is a core psychological motive developed through human evolutionary history that continue to have a significant impact on consumer behavior today. It is a part of the [[Framework of Fundamental Motives and Consumption]].

As a group-living species, humans not only desire to affiliate ([[Affiliation]]); they also seek to gain status in their groups. 
- Dominant animals (alpha leaders) get first crack at food, best spots at the watering hole, and get to mate with the most desirable females (Sapolsky 2005).  

Emotions that often correspond to status are pride, respect, awe, admiration, but also **envy and arrogance**.  

### Philosophical Foundations to "Attaining Status"
- **Jean-Paul Sartre (1943)**: Being and Nothingness Having and being are the central modes of human existence (and not doing).  
- **Karl Marx (1848)**: Communist Manifesto Real happiness is not achieved through having (‘commodity fetishism) but through doing meaningful and rewarded work.  
- **Erich Fromm (1976)**: Having or Being Being is the mode to realize and maintain one’s identity. *“If I am what I have and if what I have is lost, who then am I?”*

### Recession and Status
Interestingly, recessions lead to more behaviour towards signaling/acquiring stats

Recessions foster consumers’ anxiety about financial losses or unemployment, resulting in status anxiety.  
- As such, the need for signaling status is higher during periods of recession to compensate for status anxiety

### Powerlessness and Status Consumption  
The phenomenon of status consumption through recessions and among socially/financially deprived groups can be explained trough a need to compensate for powerlessness (Rucker and Galinsky 2008).  

Consumers low on perceived status have a higher willingness to pay for products that can signal status (i.e., luxury goods).  
- Because status means power, luxury consumption can be referred to as compensatory consumption.  
- Also social exclusion increases luxury consumption (Mead et al. 2010)  

As such: Consumer not only use luxury goods to signal status to others, but also to themselves. 


### Other Important Phenomena Related to Acquiring Status
- After an important achievement, people are more motivated to show-off their increased status by seeking products that can be displayed to others (Griskevicius, Shiota and Nowlis 2010).  
- Purchasing and wearing luxury brands make people more selfish: They prioritize personal goals over group goals (Maner and Mead 2012).  

However, acquiring status is not always selfish:  
- Status can also be enhanced through self-sacrifice (Hardy & Van Vugt, 2006).

Status can also be attained from showcasing "going green" or even through non-conformity
