Haptics refers to the science and technology of transmitting and understanding information through touch. 
- This encompasses both the tactile sensations that humans perceive when they interact with objects (such as texture, temperature, and resistance) and the technologies designed to simulate these sensations in digital or remote environments.
- As such, it is a part of [[Sensory Marketing]].


### Two Magical Laws of Haptics
1. The magical law of contagion:  
	- When a source object touches a target object, the source will spill-over and continue to influence the target even after it stops touching it.  

2. And the law of sympathetic magic:  
	- The source transfers some of its properties to the target through touch (spill-over)


## Examples of Haptics Influencing Consumer Behaviour
**The Negative Effects of a Stranger’s  Touch:**
- Consumers generally evaluate products previously touched by other shoppers (i.e. strangers) less favorably.  
- Consumers, when accidentally touch by another consumer, report more negative brand evaluations, negative product beliefs, less willingness to pay, and spend less time in-store (Martin 2011)

**The Positive Effects of a Stranger’s  Touch:**
- Product evaluations are higher when consumers perceive a product as having been physically touched by a highly attractive other of the opposite sex (Argo et al. 2008)
- A waitress (but not waiter) that physically touches a customer receives a higher tip (25%; Crusco and Wetzel 1984).
- Touch of a waitress results in more alcohol consumption of men and women (Kaufman and Mahoney 1999).  
- Book return rate improves at libraries when students checking out books are touched.
