Culture, in a broad sense, is a complex system of shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that the members of society use to cope with their world and with one another, and that are transmitted from generation to generation through learning.

*“Culture is the collective programming of the mind that distinguishes the members of one category of people from those of another.”* (Hofstede)

It is the underlying basis for strategies, tactics, and planning in terms of [[International Consumer Psychology]]. 

## Relation to [[International Consumer Psychology]]
In relation to international consumer psychology, culture is a critical factor that influences consumer behavior across different countries and societies. It affects how consumers perceive products, make purchasing decisions, interact with brands, and engage in consumption practices.


## Different Concepts within Cultures
- Colours - colours have different meanings across cultures
- Communication styles & languages - some cultures only have one word for something while other have multiple and/or one word may have multiple meanings

#### High-context and Low-context Cultures
Cultures can be divided into high-context and low-context. Below are some examples of what this might show:

- High-context = everything is understood through a filter of the context
- Low-context = everything can be understood without the context

#### Cultural Sensitivity

The image shows different product categories and their cultural sensitivity, which marketers can use to understand how much of the context they need to take into account.
- E.g. wanting to sell pizza in Italy requires the Italian context surrounding food
	- Selling integrated circuits in Italy not as much

1. **Product Adaptation (Vertical Axis)**: This axis represents the degree to which products need to be adapted or modified to meet the local conditions or preferences in different markets. "High" adaptation suggests significant changes are needed for a product to be suitable or appealing in a new market, while "Low" means the product can be sold as is across various markets.
    
2. **Environmental Sensitivity (Horizontal Axis)**: This axis indicates how sensitive a product is to the cultural, economic, or physical environment in which it is sold. "High" environmental sensitivity means that local environmental factors greatly affect the product’s use or success, while "Low" suggests the product is relatively unaffected by the environment and can be sold globally without much alteration.

So basically you need to understand the concept of [[Adaptation vs. Standardization]]
