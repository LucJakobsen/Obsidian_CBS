### Quotes about Country Image Relevance
- “The origin of a product has never been more important in the minds of consumers” (in Marketing Magazine 2005).  
- “It is hard to tell products apart, so tying in strong emotions to differentiate products is important. The country of origin is nine tenths of the magic" (Major Consulting Firm 2017)  
- “93 percent said it is good to know the origin of a product such as where it came from and who made it. People are no longer happy to pay for something superficial and hollow” (in Marketing Magazine 2017).  
- “[...] Consumers expect global brands to tell the myth from the particular places that are associated with the brand” (in Harvard Business Review 2006).

### Country Image Facets
Many products have more than one origin:  
- Origin of Design  
- Origin of Assembly  
- Origin of Manufacture  
- Origin of the company/brand  

What counts is what the consumer perceives as the product origin!  The origin of association.


### Different Types of Country Image
- Basic origin image (BOI): An image about the country itself.  
- Product origin image (POI): An image about the country as an origin of products.  
- Category origin image (COI): An image about the country as an origin of a specific product category (e.g. cars).  

Images of one country can vary tremendously across product categories (e.g. German cars and  
German fashion).
- The more information we have the more our image changes
	- The less information, we use more and more abstract information

While there are varying image levels, there are also varying geographical levels:

Managers will typically signal their product origin (relates to [[Signaling Theory]])
- Signal can be honest or dishonest

So they use it to:
- Signaling – flaunt/hide
- Dishonest signaling (at times referred to as foreign branding or origin mimicry) is based on an evolutionary successful adaptation for some animals

- Flaunt-Hide axiom
	- Says: "developed countries should flaunt their origin, less developed should hide their origin"
