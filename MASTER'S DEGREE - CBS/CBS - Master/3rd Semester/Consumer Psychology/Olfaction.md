Olfaction is the sense of smell, the process by which the nose and the brain detect and interpret odors. In terms of [[Sensory Marketing]], it refers to the strategic use of scents to influence consumers' perceptions, emotions, and behaviors towards a brand or product.


The connection between smell and memory is extremely strong: Smell makes us re-experience events and feelings that have taken place long ago.  

Despite popular opinions, the type and intensity of scent (in reasonable amounts) has no effect on consumer behavior.  
- However, consumers subjects in no-scented stores condition perceived having spent significantly more time in the store than they actually did (Spangenberg et al. 1996)
