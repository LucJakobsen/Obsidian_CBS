Costly Signaling Theory, often associated with the work of biologist Amotz Zahavi, is a concept from evolutionary biology that is related to the motive [[Acquiring a Mate]] and explains how organisms communicate their qualities to others by signals that are costly to produce or maintain. 
- The theory is based on the idea that only signals that are costly to produce are reliable; because they are difficult to fake, they can be trusted by other members of the species.

Costly signaling theory explains that apparently wasteful (‘costly’) behavior functions as a reliable signal of desirable individual qualities (Saad 2007).  
- The costs involved in producing the signal, in terms of energy, risk, time or money, guarantees the reliability of the signal (‘handicap principle’). 

Example: Costly signaling of a peacock  
A peacock may look beautiful but this is not the reason why he attracts partners; it is the cost implied to his look: By affording a beautiful tail, the peacock shows that he can flee from predators or counter parasites (‘he can afford the handicap’).
- Indicates survival-relevant fitness

### Consumption and Costly Signaling
Similar to the peacock, the consumption of luxury products (see motive 4 [[Attaining Status]]) is motivated by costly signaling, override desires to obtain goods at bargain prices

Buying expensive luxury goods is not necessary (and often meaningless), still buying them therefore indicates financial fitness.  

In order to qualify as a costly signal, three criteria need to be met:  
1. The signal must be easily observable.  
2. The signal must be hard to fake.  
3. The signal must be associated with an unobservable, yet desirable, individual quality, such as good genes, health or wealth.  

### Costly Signaling and Genders
Men with short-term mating motives (i.e. casual sex) engange in costly signaling significantly more often than men with long-term motives (Sundie et al. 2010).  
- Similarly, women who seek short-term mating are attracted by, for example, Porsches, women who seek long-term mating are often repulsed

Men who seek long-term mating partners (i.e. romantic relationships) by excessively using costly signaling are more likely attract women with short-term mating motives.  
- In consequence, the relationship is based on different expectations of the partners, increasing the probability that it will not last.  
- A relationship therapist would say: The reason why your relationships don‘t last is because you attract the ‚wrong‘ type of mating partner by sending out the wrong signals subconsciously.
