Evading Physical Harm is a core psychological motive developed through human evolutionary history that continue to have a significant impact on consumer behavior today. It is a part of the [[Framework of Fundamental Motives and Consumption]].


Peopleâ€™s motive of self-protection derives from the various dangers and the high homicide rate that our ancestors faced (Neuberg et al. 2011).  

The self-protection system is automatically activated by cues indicating physical danger, such as angry faces, snakes, spiders, horror movies, strange men or simply the dark (Schaller et al. 2003).  

The emotion that signals danger to the individual is **fear**.  

Activation of the system leads people to:  
- Take fewer risks (Lerner and Keltner 2001)  
- Prefer the status-quo (Jost and Hunyady 2005)  
- Be aversive to losses (i.e. prevention focused) (Li et al. 2012)  
- Become collectivistic (Griskevicius et al. 2009)
