The preference for the status quo, often linked to the endowment effect, is a cognitive [[Bias]] that leads individuals to value an owned item more than if they did not own it, simply because they possess it. 
- This bias can cause a reluctance to change from the current situation or to trade the owned item for another of equal value.

The endowment effect is part of what creates the preference for the status quo. It's the phenomenon where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them



### Relation to the Motive "[[Evading Physical Harm]]"
The preference for the status quo and the endowment effect can relate to the motive of avoiding physical harm through a psychological and behavioral inclination to stick with what is familiar. 

Familiarity in the status quo is often perceived as safe, while change can be perceived as risky and potentially harmful. Here's how these concepts interconnect:
1. **Familiarity**: Familiar objects and environments are perceived as safer because their risks are known and manageable, whereas new alternatives might have unknown risks.
    
2. **Risk Aversion**: People tend to be risk-averse when it comes to their physical well-being. Maintaining the status quo is a way to avoid potential physical harm that could come from untested or unknown products, services, or behaviors.
    
3. **Loss Aversion**: The endowment effect is a manifestation of loss aversion, where the potential loss (in this case, physical harm from an unfamiliar choice) is weighted more heavily than an equivalent gain. Therefore, people might irrationally overvalue their current situation as it represents a known quantity with perceived lower risk of harm.
