A brand community is a specialized, non-geographically bound community, based  
on a structured set of social relations among admirers of a [[Brands|brand]] (Muniz and  
Oâ€™Guinn 2001).  
- It is formed of people who share a common interest in a specific brand and who participate in ongoing discussions and activities surrounding the brand

Characteristics of a brand community:  
- **Shared Consciousness:** The collective sense of difference from others not in the community.  
- **Rituals and Traditions:** These rituals and traditions typically center on shared consumption experiences with the brand (e.g., queuing up for new iPhone).  
- **Moral Responsibility:** Felt sense of duty or obligation to the community as a whole, and to its individual members
