Sensory marketing is a strategy that targets the senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell) of consumers to create a specific perception of a product or brand that enhances the consumer experience, influences [[Emotions]], and drives [[Emotions & Decision-making|purchasing decisions]].
- So it is “marketing that engages the consumers' senses and affects their perception, judgment, and behavior” (Krishna 2012).  

#### Examples of senses that sensory marketing can touch upon:
- Touch ([[Haptics]]): The effect of touch and being touched.  
- [[Temperature]]: The effect of temperature.  
- Smell: The effect of [[Olfaction]].  
- [[Movement]]: The effect of movement and balance.  
- Vision: The effect of different colors/shapes.
