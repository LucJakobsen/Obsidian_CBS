The hedonic principle holds that “people approach pleasure and avoid pain” and has  
been an underlying assumption in much psychology research (Higgins, 1998, p. 1) 
- In this way it also relates to [[Hedonic Consumption]]

In many cases, this does hold true. Consider, for example, insight from the  
fundamental motives:  
- People wish to avoid diseases ([[Avoiding Disease]]) and social exclusion ([[Affiliation]])  
that cause pain  
- People are motivated to make friends ([[Affiliation]]) and attain status  ([[Attaining Status]]) within groups (status) which can lead to pleasure  

However, in some situations people seem to actively engage in activities that also  
involve pain as relating to [[Consumption of Painful Activities]]
