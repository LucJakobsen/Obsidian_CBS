Xenophilia is the affection for unknown, foreign objects, peoples, or cultures. It is the opposite of Xenophobia (see e.g. [[Avoiding Disease]]), which represents a fear or dislike of the unfamiliar. Xenophilia is characterized by a curiosity and fascination with different cultures, languages, and people, and it often leads to a desire to explore and embrace cultural diversity.
- So it means an attraction to foreignness â€“ in the shape of destinations, people, cultures etc.  

Xenophilia has been linked to the motive of [[Exploration]]
- Xenophilia is rooted in the exploration motive as a way of inciting exploratory behaviours  
- Xenophilia has various implications for how tourists act: For example, increased willingness to visit foreign countries and to interact with locals (Norfelt et al., 2019)  
- In a broader consumer context, xenophilia may lead to a preference for foreign companies and products
