Sexually Selective Cognition is a concept in [[Evolutionary Psychology]] and a part of [[Selective Cognition]] that suggests individuals' cognitive processes are shaped by evolutionary pressures related to sexual selection. This means that the way people think, perceive, and make decisions can be influenced by underlying motivations to increase their reproductive success.
- In this way it is also connected in a way to [[Evolutionary Aesthetics]]


- Both sexes selectively attend to and remember attractive females.  
- Women selectively attend to good-looking male targets but they do not selectively remember them or overestimate their frequency.  
- Men do not selectively attend to, remember, or overestimate attractive male targets.  
- It is not that opposite-sexed beauty captures the mind but that female beauty captures the mind of the beholder.  

- The frequency of attractive females, but not males, is likely to be overestimated in a stimulus array when attentional capacities are limited


### Sexual Signaling & Colour
- Sexual signaling (and in extension sexually selective cognition), has a relation to the colour of **red**
- In many nonhuman primates, the color red enhances malesâ€™ attraction to females (e.g., sexual swelling when nearing ovulation).  
- Red, relative to any other color, leads men to view women as more attractive and more sexually desirable because it carries meaning of fertility (Elliot and Niesta 2008).
- Elliot and Pazda (2012) found that women indeed use red clothing to signal sexual intent on dating websites

- However red can also be associated with aggression and dominance
