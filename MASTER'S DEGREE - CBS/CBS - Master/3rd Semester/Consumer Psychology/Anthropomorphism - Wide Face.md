Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities (see [[Anthropomorphic Products]]). 

Evolutionary psychology documents that face width-to-height ratio can signal dominance and aggression. 
- People are typically averse to wider human faces because they elicit fears.  
- Products with wide faces are perceived to be more aggressive and dominant.  
- Hoping to be seen as powerful, consumers prefer wider faces on watches or cars (Maeng and Aggarwal 2017).  

Remember status consumption as evolutionary motive:  
- People who feel powerless have a higher preference for products with wide designs (compensatory consumption)

### Relation to the Motive "[[Evading Physical Harm]]"
- **Perceived Aggression and Threat**: Anthropomorphized objects with wide faces might be perceived, on a subconscious level, as more aggressive or dominant due to the associations people have with such facial structures in humans. 
	- This perception could potentially activate a motive to avoid physical harm, as people may instinctively be cautious around entities that appear strong or capable of exerting force.
    
- **Safety and Assurance**: Conversely, in some contexts, the presence of strong or dominant features in anthropomorphized objects (like security systems) could convey a sense of protection and deterrence, aligning with the motive to avoid harm by leveraging the implied "strength" of the product to keep potential threats at bay.
