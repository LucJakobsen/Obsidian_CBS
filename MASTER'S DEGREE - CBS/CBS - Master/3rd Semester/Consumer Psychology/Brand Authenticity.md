Brand authenticity refers to the extent to which consumers perceive a [[Brands|brand]] to be genuine, true to its values, and faithful to its promises and commitments.

Consumers look for brands that are relevant, original, and  genuine, in other words: authentic, because they are confronted with increasing commercialization, an overflow of the fake, and an omnipresence of meaningless market offers (Boyle 2004)

Brand authenticity (BA) can be constructed along four dimensions:  
1. **Continuity**: BA involves maintaining consistency with the brand's history and heritage, ensuring that its core identity and values are preserved over time.

2. **Credibility**: BA is upheld by the brand's ability to genuinely deliver on its promises and claims, demonstrating reliability and expertise in its field.

3. **Symbolism**: BA encompasses the brand's ability to authentically reflect and resonate with the customers' values, culture, and identity.

4. **Integrity**: BA is characterized by the brand's honesty, moral principles, and commitment to doing what is right for its customers, society, and the environment.
