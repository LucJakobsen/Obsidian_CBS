Dialecticism is a philosophical concept and cognitive style that emphasizes the acceptance of contradictions and the integration of opposing viewpoints or elements.

It is a universal philosophy focusing on how to deal with contradictions in life, and is characterized by two elements:
1. The belief that the world (reality) is constantly changing, so that oppositions and paradoxes are continuously being created.
2. The belief that those contradictions can be regarded as natural, to be accepted, tolerated, and dealt with.


Some deal with cognitive inconsistency better than others:  
- Less-dialectical individuals tend to pursue a single truth and have a preference for consistency. 
- Higher-dialectical individuals instead seek to understand both sides of the coin and manage contradiction


Dialecticism therefore helps explain why some people's [[Mental Representations]] aren't always consistent
