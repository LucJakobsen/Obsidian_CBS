[[Emotions]] play a critical role in decision-making processes by influencing how we perceive options, evaluate risks and rewards, and ultimately make choices.


*In order to have anything like a complete theory of human rationality, we  
have to understand what role emotion plays in it.*  Herbert Simon (1983, p. 29).  

Humans cope with [[Bounded Rationality]] by using [[Heuristics]].  
- One important heuristic is the ‚how-do-I-feel-about-it?‘-heuristic
	- Research documents that people use their momentary feelings, and feelings toward an object as actual sources of information (‘feelings-as-information’; Pham 2004; Schwarz 1990).

In fact, Consumers are more likely to rely on their feelings because feelings are often  
elicited immediately on exposure to a new stimulus, before cognition (Pham et al.  
2001).  
- Similar to system 1 thinking from [[Kahneman, D. (2003). A Perspective on Judgment and Choice]] / [[Dual Processes of the Mind]]
- As such, people can experience emotions about an object, and acting on these emotions, before thinking about that object (Zajonc and Markus 1982).  
Zajonc (1984) suggests [[The Mere-Exposure Effect]]



Feelings-as-information is often used for decisions about objects unrelated to the feeling. This carryover is referred to as [[Incidental Emotions]].
