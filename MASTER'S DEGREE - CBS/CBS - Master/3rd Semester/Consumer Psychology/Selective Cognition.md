Selective cognition refers to the process by which individuals selectively attend to, process, and remember information that is relevant or consistent with their existing beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions. It's a fundamental aspect of human cognition, highlighting how people are not passive recipients of information, but actively engage with it based on their preferences, biases, and psychological motivations.
