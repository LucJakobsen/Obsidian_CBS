Consumer disidentification is the phenomenon where individuals deliberately distance themselves from a brand or product as a way of rejecting the values or image it represents. This can be due to a misalignment with personal values, ethical considerations, or a desire to dissociate from the brand's community or what it symbolizes.
- It is defined as a negative disposition to be likened to the domestic consumers or their consumption culture (Josiassen 2011)  
- Consumer disidentification is founded on [[The Dissimilarity Hypothesis]] and [[Social Identity Theory]]
	- And is a part of  [[The Consumer Attraction‐Repulsion Matrix]]
- This phenomenon is often linked with immigrants or descendents of immigrants and their attitudes towards their new country of residence
	- As opposed to [[Consumer Affinity]]


Depending on the specific context, disidentification is theoretically based on theories of power and rebellion from Freudian Theories (“Independence cannot be granted by Authority, but must be wrested from it” (Vella, 1999, p. 17)”, to the notion of incohesion (Hopper 2001), and an anti‐group tendency (Nitsun (1996).  
- Disidentification also draw on early works about power struggles in groups, and group rebellion by Nietzsche and Marx.


#### Other Theoretical Backgrounds
- Relative deprivation theory (Gurr 1968, 1970) asserts that sub‐groups become frustrated and form attitudes and act against the dominant group 
- Power contention theory (Finkel, Muller & Opp 1989) is a rival explanation which posits that such frustration will only really take hold if there is a rational way to achieve a better outcome.  
- Optimal distinctiveness theory is a social psychological theory seeking to understand ingroup–outgroup differences. It asserts that individuals desire to attain an optimal balance of inclusion and distinctiveness within and between social groups and situations (Brewer, 2003).  

Consumer disidentification can arise for reasons which are political, ethnic, value, religion etc
