Brand sabotage is a type of negative consumer-brand relationship (see [[Brands]]), and refers to deliberate actions by individuals or groups aimed at damaging a brand's reputation, financial health, or customer relationships
- So it is the deliberate behavior by customers or non-customers who have the dominant objective of causing harm to a brand via the impairment of the brand-related associations of other consumers

Brand Sabotage comprises:  
- Motive-inconsistent appraisals  
- Anger, Frustration, Outrage, Hatred (referred to as hostile aggression)
