Individuals are constantly processing information about the world and adjusting their behavior accordingly. We use our [[Mental Representations]] to decide whether or not to purchase something. We don't know which we use and how we use them.

Generally we look at two ways in which we make decisions:
1. **The Systematic Approach** - where many aspects of a problem are taken into account to form an opinion, or make a decision.
	- E.g. looking at a spreadsheet with information about cars before buying a car

2. **The Heuristic Approach** - where intuition, instinct or the "sixth sense" is often applied  when making decisions 

These approaches are also sometimes called system 1 and system 2 thinking

Individuals can use different heuristics to make adequate decisions
- So not as good as the systematic but still good enough generally


So it's basically a toggle between precision and effort
- Systematic are generally more precise but require more effort
	- However it is not always the case. Sometimes our subconscious mind can process things better than when we really focus on it


### Dual Processes of the Mind & Involvement
Higher involved individuals value arguments more (systematic), and less involved individuals rely more on singular cues (heuristics)
