In terms of [[Sensory Marketing]], temperature refers to the strategic use of warmth or coolness in the environment, products, or packaging to influence consumers' perceptions and behaviors. 
- The temperature can affect a consumer's comfort level, mood, and perception of a brand or product.


**Examples:**
- Physical coldness in cinemas increases consumption and liking of romance movies (Hong and Sun 2011). Similarly, people watch more romantic movies on Netflix on cold days.  
	- Explanation: Consumers subconsciously substitute physical coldness by emotional warmth.  
- People who feel lonely judge room temperature to be lower (Zhong et al. 2008).  
- Warm temperatures increase consumers' evaluation of products (Zwebner et al. 2013)
