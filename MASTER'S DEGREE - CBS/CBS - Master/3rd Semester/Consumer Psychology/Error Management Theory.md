Error Management Theory (EMT) is a concept in [[Evolutionary Psychology]] that suggests humans have evolved to make particular types of errors in judgment under conditions of uncertainty.

Basically Error Management Theory (ETM; Haselton and Buss 2000) distinguishes between two errors that humans can make:  
1) A false-positive error (alpha error)  
2) A false-negative error (beta error)

	- So it's kind of similar to [[Type 1 Error]] and [[Type 2 Error]] from statistics

### Example
For example, if an ancestor heard a rustle in the grass, it could be due to wind or a dangerous predator. 

EMT suggests that it would be less costly to make the "error" of assuming it's a predator and fleeing (false positive) than to assume it's the wind and risk getting eaten (false negative)

Because the cost of the false-negative is much greater, EMT predicts that humans tend to do false-positive errors to survive.
