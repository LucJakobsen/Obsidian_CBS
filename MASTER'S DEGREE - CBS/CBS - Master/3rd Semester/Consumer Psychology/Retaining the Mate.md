Retaining the Mate is a core psychological motive developed through human evolutionary history that continue to have a significant impact on consumer behavior today. It is a part of the [[Framework of Fundamental Motives and Consumption]].


For 95% of all mammals, mating is a short-term affair that ends after copulation (Geary  
2000).  
- For humans (or gibbons), relationships rather start or continue after mating in order to enhance the survival fitness of the offspring.  
- The challenge of mate retention is very different from that of finding a mate (Erich Fromm 1976).  

The mate retention system is triggered by cues that celebrate (or threaten) long-term  
relationships (e.g., romantic movies).  

Whereas a mate acquisition motive leads people to be more attentive to attractive  
members of the opposite sex, a mate retention motive leads people to be more  
attentive to attractive members of the same sex (Maner et al. 2009)
- As they are seen as competitors

### Retaining the Mate, Consumption, & Gender
Where men use conspicuous consumption (motive 4 [[Attaining Status]]) for mate acquisition,  
women use it for mate retention
- Women use costly signaling when a motive of guarding oneâ€™s mate is triggered.  
- Women use pricey possessions to signal that their romantic partner is especially devoted to them.  
	- Luxury handbags were effective at deterring other women from poaching a relationship partner
	- (NOTE! This is quite a stereotypical view so take with a grain of salt)

[[Parental Investment Theory]] explains why men use sexual signaling for mate acquisition and women for mate retention.  
- Similarly, it explains why men have a greater desire for casual sex and women have a greater desire for long-term commitment (Meyers-Levi and Loken 2015).  

Sexual cues are more effective for males than females:  
- Toward sexually explicit content, women respond more negatively than men
