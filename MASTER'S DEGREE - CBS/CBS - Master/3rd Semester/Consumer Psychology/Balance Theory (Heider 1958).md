Balance theory is a psychological theory that explains how individuals strive for consistency in their relationships and perceptions.

It is grounded in the principle of **Cognitive Consistency**, suggesting that people prefer relationships and attitudes that are harmonious and consistent over those that are imbalanced or dissonant


### Cognitive consistency and POX-model
The theory say people strive for the consistency within a triadic relationship involving the self (P for person), another person (O for other), and an object or idea (X)

So Heider argues there should be a balance between P, O, and X
