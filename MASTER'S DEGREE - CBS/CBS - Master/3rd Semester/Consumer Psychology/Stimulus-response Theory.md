Stimulus-Response Theory is a psychological concept asserting that behavior is a direct result of environmental stimuli. It emphasizes that behaviors are learned through conditioning, where stimuli elicit specific responses.
- So that humans respond because of a stimulus
- Signaling ([[Signaling Theory]]) works as a stimulus
- Stimulus can be intrinsic or extrinsic to the body




**Conditioning**: A significant part of S-R Theory is the process of conditioning, where behaviors are learned. There are two primary types of conditioning:
- **Classical Conditioning** (also known as Pavlovian conditioning), where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a naturally occurring stimulus and begins to produce a similar response. A classic example is Pavlov's dogs, where the sound of a bell (neutral stimulus) was paired with the presentation of food (unconditioned stimulus), eventually leading the dogs to salivate (conditioned response) at the sound of the bell alone.
- **Operant Conditioning** (or Skinnerian conditioning), where behaviors are modified based on the consequences that follow them. Behaviors followed by positive outcomes are likely to be repeated, while those followed by negative outcomes are less likely to be repeated.
