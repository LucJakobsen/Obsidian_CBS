Appraisal theories link cognitions with [[Emotions]], and thereby explain how emotions arise.
- Examples include e.g., Arnold 1970; Frijda 1986; Smith and Ellsworth 1985

So they are a group of theories in psychology that explain how people's evaluations (appraisals) of events, situations, or stimuli lead to specific emotional reactions


### Appraisal
Appraisal is how we think about and judge something based on how important it is to our own happiness and well-being (stimuli)

What we evaluate and think about can be an event - "event" can be an incident, episode, a behavior of oneself or someone else, or an object, person or thought that has personal meaning

Different types of appraisal exists, and their combination determines which type of emotion will be experienced (Roseman 1991). The most important appraisal types are:  
- **Motive-Consistency vs. Inconsistency**: This appraisal evaluates whether a situation matches or clashes with our goals or desires.

- **Coping Potential (Powerful vs. Powerless)**: This determines whether we feel capable of handling a situation or overwhelmed by it.

- **Agency (Self-/Other-Caused vs. Circumstance-caused)**: This identifies who or what is responsible for an event, whether it's oneself, someone else, or the situation.

- **Certain vs. Uncertain (Probability)**: This assesses how likely or unlikely an event is to happen, impacting our response to potential outcomes.

- **Appetitive vs. Aversive**: This judges whether an event is appealing and draws us toward it, or unpleasant and makes us want to avoid it.

#### Example:
*You see a single person (without children) parking on a ‘family parking spot’. You (with two little children) cannot find another parking spot.*  
- Motive... is inconsistent because the other person prevents your goal of finding a parking spot. 
- Coping-potential... is high because you think you can change the situation as only you have a right to park here.  
- Agency... is other-caused because the person made the deliberate decision to park here.  
- Probability... is high because the person already parked.  
- The appraisal is appetitive as you aim to gain a positive outcome (parking spot).  

--> In consequence, you likely feel Anger.
