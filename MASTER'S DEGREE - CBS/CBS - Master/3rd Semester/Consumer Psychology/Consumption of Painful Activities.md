The consumption of painful activities refers to the phenomenon where individuals voluntarily engage in activities that are physically or emotionally uncomfortable, challenging, or even painful, deriving pleasure, satisfaction, or fulfillment from them. This concept is intriguing within consumer behavior and psychology because it seems to contradict [[The Hedonic Principle]].


### Proximate Explanations  
Engagement in these types of activities has been explained in various ways:  
- A way to “collect” memorable experiences (Liu et al., 2018)  
- A way to escape boring everyday life (Scott et al., 2017)  
- Benign masochism: “enjoying initially negative experiences that the body (brain) falsely interprets as threatening” (Rozin et al., 2013, p. 439)  

These represent more proximate explanations because they focus on relatively immediate reasons for a behavior

### Evolutionary Explanations
1) Threat simulation
	- Humans may engage in painful activities because they constitute simulations of potentially dangerous scenarios. Simulating such scenarios could be a way of learning to deal with such situations should they arise.  
	- For example, watching horror movies may be a way to simulate strategies of how to escape an attack (Clasen et al., 2020)

2) Acquiring a good position in the social hierarchy  
	- Enduring painful and difficult situations may signal strength to others which could confer status advantages  
	- For example, “Who can eat the spiciest chili or go on the scariest rollercoaster?
