Image Theory, in the context of intergroup relations and social psychology, is a framework that helps to explain how people form and maintain certain [[Mental Representations]] (images) of other groups. 
- This theory examines the cognitive processes behind the [[Stereotyping|stereotypes ]]and prejudices towards outgroups, which are groups that individuals do not identify as belonging to.

The table illustrates different scenarios of intergroup relations:
- When goals are compatible, and status and power are equal, groups are likely to cooperate and view each other as allies.
- When goals are incompatible but status and power remain equal, the orientation may be containment or attack, viewing the other as an enemy.
- If the outgroup has lower status but higher power, and goals are incompatible, the ingroup may adopt defensive protection and see the outgroup as barbarians.
- When the outgroup has lower status and power, and goals are incompatible, the likely behavior is exploitation or paternalism, with the outgroup being seen as dependent.
- Lastly, if the outgroup has lower status and power, and goals are incompatible, the ingroup may resist or rebel, perceiving the outgroup as imperialist.


Overall, different perceptions of intergroup dynamics lead to various stereotypes and behaviors, which can range from cooperative to hostile, depending on how groups perceive each other's intentions and capabilities.
