Consumers of luxury products can be segmented in terms of their pecuniary strength and need for status (Han et al. 2010).  
- Marketers address consumers needs for associations and disassociations by designed ‚loud‘ and ‚quit‘ products, and price them at different levels.

The image describes how consumers of luxury products can be segmented based on their financial means (pecuniary strength) and their desire for [[Attaining Status]]. 

Han et al. (2010) suggest that consumers' behavior towards luxury goods can be understood in terms of their tendency to either associate with certain groups or dissociate from others. Marketers can then tailor their strategies by creating and pricing products that either conspicuously display wealth (loud products) or discreetly signal status (quiet products) to cater to these different consumer segments:

1. **Patricians (Haves with Low Need for Status)**: These are wealthy individuals who do not feel the need to display their wealth loudly. They prefer subtle, often exclusive signals that are recognizable only to others like them.
    
2. **Parvenus (Haves with High Need for Status)**: These individuals have wealth and a high need to display it. They use conspicuous consumption to signal their status, preferring loud and ostentatious displays of wealth that are easily recognized by everyone.
    
3. **Proletarians (Have-nots with Low Need for Status)**: This group does not have much wealth and has a low need for status signaling. They typically do not engage in behaviors aimed at displaying wealth they do not have.
    
4. **Poseurs (Have-nots with High Need for Status)**: Although not wealthy, these individuals have a high desire to appear as if they are. They mimic the parvenus by engaging in conspicuous consumption to the extent that their means allow, often prioritizing status signaling over actual wealth accumulation.
    

The light arrows in the diagram indicate associations or similarities, while the dark arrows indicate dissociations or efforts to differentiate from another group. 

**For example**, parvenus dissociate from have-nots by showing off their wealth, while poseurs try to associate with haves despite not having the same level of wealth.
