Evolutionary aesthetics refers to an area of study that explores how aspects of evolutionary theory ([[Evolutionary Psychology]]), particularly mechanisms like natural selection and [[Sexually Selective Cognition]], can explain human appreciation of beauty and art, as well as our creation of aesthetically pleasing artifacts and artistic expressions

- Related to their exploration efforts ([[Exploration]]), our ancestors evolved preferences for certain landscape features that would have aided survival  
- Natural elements have been linked to well-being and pleasure (Joye et al., 2011)  
- Staying in a room with a view to nature leads to better health outcomes in hospitals (Ulrich, 1984)  
- The preference for shiny products as a result of an innate need for water (Meert et al., 2014)


### Evolution & Shapes
The vast majority of products in the marketplace is rectangular (Raghubir and Greenleaf 2006).  
- But curves are generally felt to be more beautiful than straight lines (Gordon 1909; Parise and Spence 2012).  

[[Evolutionary Psychology]]provides three explanations:  
1. Rounded shapes are natural, rectangular occured only rarely in ancestral times.  
2. Rounded shapes underlie positive facial expressions of emotions, and convey semantic meaning without the need for thorough processing of the stimuli (Bassili 1979).  
3. Rounded shapes promote safety rather than impede it while angular shapes (teeth of tiger, sharp rocks, thorns of a cactus) promote avoidance (Bar and Neta 2006).

- Rounded shapes are related to pleasant emotions for various products like furniture, cars, car interiors, chocolate, water bottle or other everyday objects (Bar and Neta, 2006).  
	- For functional products, consumers prefer angular shapes.  
	- For hedonic products, consumers prefer rounded shapes
