Stereotyping is the tendency to attribute generalized and simplified characteristics (often to groups of people). 
- It often occurs in relation to [[Consumer Images]]. 
- A subset of stereotyping can be found in [[Country Stereotyping]]

Both animals and people need stereotyping to cope with the vastness of information and impression that we face daily.
- We are driven towards stereotyping because of our preference and need to use [[Heuristics]] in our decision-making (see [[Emotions & Decision-making]])
- We tend to stereotype more the less information that we have

### Two Basic Forms of Stereotyping
- **Benevolent** - Involves ascribing positive traits to a group that, while seemingly favorable, can still be limiting or patronizing.
	- E.g. when the man holds the door for a woman or gives his jacket when it's cold
- **Hostile** - Consists of attributing negative characteristics to a group, leading to prejudice and discrimination.
	- E.g. the idea that certain ethnic groups are lazy


One great way to understand stereotyping is via [[The Stereotype Content Model]]
