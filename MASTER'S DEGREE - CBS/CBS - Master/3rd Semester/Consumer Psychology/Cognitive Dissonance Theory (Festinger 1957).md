Cognitive Dissonance Theory is a psychological theory that describes the discomfort or psychological tension that arises from holding two or more contradictory beliefs, values, or attitudes simultaneously
- or from behaving in ways that contradict one's beliefs, values, or attitudes
- so we are not pulled toward consistency because we prefer it, but are pushed away from dissonance because we dislike it 


It relates to [[Balance Theory (Heider 1958)]].
