Anthropomorphic products are those that have been designed or presented in a way that attributes human characteristics, traits, or behaviors to them. This can include giving products human-like faces, voices, emotions, or personalities. 
- The practice of anthropomorphism in product design and marketing is used to enhance consumer engagement and emotional connection with the product.

- the anticipated need to engage with close others in the future, and  
- the willingness to engage in prosocial behavior
