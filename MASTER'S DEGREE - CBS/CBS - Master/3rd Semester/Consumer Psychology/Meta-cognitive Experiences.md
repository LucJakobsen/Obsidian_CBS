Meta-cognitive experiences are the thoughts and reflections about one's own cognitive processes, such as thinking, learning, remembering, and understanding. 

These experiences involve awareness and regulation of one's cognitive activities, including evaluating the ease or difficulty of a task, monitoring one's comprehension and memory, and making judgments about what one knows or doesn't know.
- Put differently, there is more to thinking than thought content: The subjective experiences that accompany our thought processes are informative in their own right (‘thinking about thinking’).

- So it relates a bit to system 2 thinking from [[Kahneman, D. (2003). A Perspective on Judgment and Choice]] / [[Dual Processes of the Mind]]
	- However the "thinking about thinking" usually happens subconciously

### Ease
An important part of the meta-cognitive experiences is ease:
- Ease: The perceived relevance and diagnosticity of our thoughts is enhanced when they come to mind easily (e.g., Higgins, 1998)
	- So it is the feeling of how effortlessly we think, understand, or remember something, influencing how confident we feel about our knowledge or decisions.


### The Paradox of Choice
In relation to meta-cognitive experiences are also the Paradox of choice which explains the phenomenon that consumers, while usually better off with more choice options become less satisfied (and more anxious) with their choice when the number of options increases (Schwartz 2004). 
- Basically "what if the other product was better and now I didn't buy it"

Reasons are:  
- Anticipated regret: More options means more potentially missed opportunities, resulting in regret (what if...).  
- Negative meta-cognitive experiences: Meta-cognitive experiences explain how we think (or feel) about thinking. More options increase unpleasant feelings while we make decisions, overall lowering our satisfaction.


### Ease of Recall
Ease of recall is another example of powerful meta-cognitive experiences.
- It is the perceived effortlessness associated with retrieving information from memory, which can affect our judgment about the frequency or importance of that information.

In an experiment, Schwarz et al. (1991) asked participants to recall either 6 or 12 examples of their own assertive or unassertive behavior. Subsequently, participants rated their own assertiveness.  
- Participants rated themselves as more assertive after recalling six examples of assertive behavior Than after recalling six examples of unassertive behavior.  
- Counterintuitively, this trend is Reversed when using 12 examples
