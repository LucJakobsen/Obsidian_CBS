Principle 2 for Increasing Consumer Happiness through consumption ([[Money & Happiness]]), is as follows:
	***(2) Help others instead of yourself***

People who devote more money to prosocial spending are happier (Dunn et al. 2008).  
- **Reason I:** Spending money on other people (gifts for others, charity) addresses peopleâ€™s need for affiliation (remember the evolutionary motive!).  
- **Reason II: **Spending money on others has a powerful impact on relationships.  
- **Reason III:** Charity giving increases self-verification which increases positive emotions (Dunn et al. 2007).
