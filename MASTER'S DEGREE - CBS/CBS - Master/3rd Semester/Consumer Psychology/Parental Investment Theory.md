Parental Investment Theory, proposed by Robert Trivers in 1972, is a concept in evolutionary biology and psychology that is related to the motive of [[Acquiring a Mate]] and suggests that the extent and type of care given by parents to their offspring is determined by the benefits of investing in the offspring and the cost of investment to the parents. 

Parental investment is the contribution that each parent makes to the production of viable (i.e., reproducing) offspring.  

Parental Investment Theory (Trivers 1972) can explain differences of sexual behavior in gender.  
- Males have low parental investment: They produce offspring by investing only the energy and time necessary to have sexual intercourse.  
- Females have high parental investment: They produce offspring by investing considerable time and energy required for internal gestation and nursing.  

In consequence, females are more selective of sexual partners, leading males to generally be more competitive for sexual access to females


The theory predicts that the parent will tend to invest more in offspring when the benefits to the offspring are greater and the costs to the parent are lower.
