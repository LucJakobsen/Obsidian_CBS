Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. 

It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations – that is, the functional products of natural selection or sexual selection in human evolution
- So it is the study of how the history of human evolution shapes the way we think, feel, and behave today.
- So it's based on evolutionary biology

*“The fundamental premise (of evolutionary psychology) is that modern human beings have inherited psychological mechanisms that predispose them to act in ways that helped our ancestors to survive and procreate thousands of years ago”. (Kock et al. 2018)*


### Evolutionary Psychology & Consumer Behaviour
- Consumers consume in order to satisfy survival-relevant needs

Consumer researchers have traditionally focused on proximate mechanisms. Evolutionary psychology instead explains behavior adaptive functions (ultimate /fundamental motives):
1. **Proximate Mechanisms:** What are the triggers of this behavior?  
2. **Adaptive Function:** What causes the behavior? i.e., what adaptive problems does the behavior (ultimately) solve?

This image uses an island metaphor to illustrate two types of motives in evolutionary psychology:
- "Proximate Motive," which is the immediate reason for a behavior (like eating when hungry), 
- "Ultimate Motive," which is the evolutionary purpose of a behavior (like eating to survive and reproduce). 
- The palm trees labeled "Plasticity" indicate that these motives can adapt or change due to environmental factors.
- The "Ecology" ([[Behavioral Ecology]]) part of the island represents the environmental context that shapes and influences both the immediate, proximate motives and the deeper, evolutionary ultimate motives for behaviors.

### Short History of Human Behaviour Views
- **The ghost in the machine:** The soul makes choices free from biology (dominant for most centuries).  
- **The noble savage:** People are born as good and then corrupted by society (dominant in Romanticism).  
- **The blank slate:** The mind has no innate traits / and empty book (dominant in empiricism).  
- **Nativism:** The view that certain skills or abilities are "native" or hard-wired into the brain at birth (evolutionary psychology rests on this view).
