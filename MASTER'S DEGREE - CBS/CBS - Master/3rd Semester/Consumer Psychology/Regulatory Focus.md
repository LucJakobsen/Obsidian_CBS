Regulatory Focus Theory, proposed by psychologist E. Tory Higgins in 1997, posits that people use two different types of self-regulation to pursue their goals: promotion focus and prevention focus.

1. **Promotion-focused** consumers are motivated by achievements and are sensitive to opportunities for advancement.  
2. **Prevention- focused** consumers are motivated to avoid threats to security and safety and are sensitive to occasions of hazard.  

It is estimated that approximately half of consumers are chronically promotion focused, and the other half are prevention focused (e.g., Lee, Aaker and Gardner 2000; Lockwood, Jordan and Kunda 2002).

Promotion focus is related to eagerness and approach behavior, while prevention focus is related to vigilance and avoidance behavior.

### Relation to the Motive "[[Evading Physical Harm]]"
When individuals are in a prevention-focused state, they are primarily motivated to ensure safety and security, which includes avoiding potential threats to their physical well-being.

In essence, the prevention focus drives people to take precautionary measures, adhere to safety rules, and be cautious in their actions to preserve their health and physical integrity, directly reflecting the motive of avoiding physical harm.
