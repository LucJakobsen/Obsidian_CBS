Nudging is a concept in behavioral economics and psychology that involves subtly guiding people's choices and behaviors in predictable ways without restricting their freedom of choice or significantly changing their economic incentives
- It has hardly developed new theories; it is rather a way to using existing psychological knowledge to understand observations (and sometimes in a very trivial way)
- Nudges can be designed to enhance the perceived [[Transaction Utility]] of making a certain choice
- Nudging also relate to the [[Sunk Cost Fallacy]]

**Examples of nudges include:**
- Placing healthier foods at eye level in cafeterias to encourage better eating habits.
- Automatically enrolling employees in pension plans but allowing them to opt out if they wish, to promote saving for retirement.
- Using social norms, like indicating the majority of neighbors are conserving energy, to encourage energy saving.
