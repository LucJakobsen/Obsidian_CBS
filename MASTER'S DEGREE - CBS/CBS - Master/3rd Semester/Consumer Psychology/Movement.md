In terms of [[Sensory Marketing]], movement refers to the use of physical motion or the suggestion of motion to capture consumers' attention, convey information, and influence their perception and experience of a brand or product. 
- Movement can be actual, as in the kinetic design of product displays that physically move to attract attention, or implied, through visual cues in advertisements that suggest motion.

### Movement - Up and Down
- Moving up (even if only imagined) increases self esteem, and in turn diminishes performance on cognitive tests (Ostinelli, Luna and Ringberg 2014).  
- Rationality is associated with up while emotion is associated with down (Cian, Krishna and Schwartz 2015).  
- Vertical head movements (‘up’) increase indulgence through lower perceived control (Wongkitrungrueng et al. 2018).  
- Going up increases risk-taking behavior (Esteky, Wineman and Wooten 2018).

### Movement - Left and Right
- People who are experiencing ambivalence move from side to side more than people who are not experiencing ambivalence (Schneider et al. 2013)  
- Leaning to the left makes the Eiffel Tower seem smaller (Eerland, Guadalupe and Zwaan 2011).  
- The Mental Number Line is a left-to-right orientation of increasing numerical values, and provides evidence for a unique connection between space and number.
