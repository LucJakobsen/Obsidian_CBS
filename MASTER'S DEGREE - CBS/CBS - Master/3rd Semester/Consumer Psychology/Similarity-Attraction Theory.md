The Similarity-Attraction Theory posits that individuals are more likely to be attracted to and form relationships with others who are similar to themselves in terms of attitudes, beliefs, interests, values, background, and personality. 
- So it posits that people like and are attracted to others who are similar, rather than dissimilar, to themselves
- Can be seen as the contrast to [[The Dissimilarity Hypothesis]]

It suggests that similarity is rewarding and leads to more predictable and comfortable interactions, reducing potential conflicts and misunderstandings.

An example of Similarity-Attraction Theory is [[Ethnocentrism]]
