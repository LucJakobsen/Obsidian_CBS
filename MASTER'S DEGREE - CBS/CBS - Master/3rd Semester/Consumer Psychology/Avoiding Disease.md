Avoiding Disease is a core psychological motive developed through human evolutionary history that continue to have a significant impact on consumer behavior today. It is a part of the [[Framework of Fundamental Motives and Consumption]].

Biologists and history document that infectious diseases have put important selection pressure on the human species: Large portions (up to 75%) of both European and North American populations were frequently wiped out by diseases such as plague or the Spanish flu (which killed up to 100 million alone) (Dobson and Carter 1996).  

A "**behavioral immune system**" helps us to avoid pathogen threat, it is automatically activated by cues such as sneezing, foul odors, bodily abnormalities, feces, dirt or body liquids (blood, sperm, pus). 

The emotion that signals a pathogen or contamination threat is **disgust.**
