Conspicuous consumption is a term introduced by economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen in his 1899 book "The Theory of the Leisure Class." It describes the act of buying and using products to publicly display economic power and social status ([[Attaining Status]]) rather than to fulfill the basic needs of the consumer.
- It is characterized by the purchase of luxury goods and services to showcase wealth and to signify belonging to a higher social class.
- It is a way for individuals to communicate their status to others



*``The basis on which good reputation in any highly organized industrial community ultimately rests is pecuniary strength; and the means of showing pecuniary strength, and so of gaining or retaining a good name, are leisure and a conspicuous consumption of goods.``*
``- Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899, p. 51)``

#### Example
In the middle ages, sumptuary laws specified in minute detail what each social class was permitted and forbidden to wear, including the maximum price an article of clothing could cost. For example, grooms could not wear cloth that exceeded two marks, and knights could wear apparel up to six marksâ€™ value but were forbidden from wearing gold, ermine, or jeweled embroidery (Han et al. 2010)

In consequence, the consumption of products can signal status and tell others who I am (Belk 1988)
