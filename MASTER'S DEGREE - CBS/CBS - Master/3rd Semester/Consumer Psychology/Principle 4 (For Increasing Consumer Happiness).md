Principle 4 for Increasing Consumer Happiness through consumption ([[Money & Happiness]]), is as follows:
	***(4) Pay now and consume later***

When people select goods for immediate consumption, they are tempted by “vices”: e.g., fattening food or lowbrow entertainment.  
- Vices provide immediate pleasure but lack long-term benefits—or even carry long-term costs—for well-being (Read and van Leeuwen 1998).  

In contrast, delayed consumption (selecting now and consume later) is more likely to  
promote the selection of “virtues,” which produce more lasting well-being


### Relation to "Credit Card Culture"
There is a shift toward immediate enjoyment and delayed payment: Credit card companies allow customers to “consume now and pay later,” so do merchants whose offers include phrases such as “Don't pay for six months!”  
- However, ‘consume now and pay later’ undermines consumer happiness (Thaler and Sunstein 2008):  
	- Reason I: It leads people to engage in shortsighted behavior—to rack up debts, to save little for retirement, education and health.  
	- Reason II: It eliminates anticipation, and anticipation is a source of “free” happiness - Anticipated Joy (better: ‘Vorfreude’)
