Mismatch theory is a concept in evolutionary biology, medicine, and [[Evolutionary Psychology]] that suggests many modern diseases and disorders arise from a mismatch between the environment and conditions for which our bodies are adapted, and the current environment in which we live. 
- It posits that rapid changes in our lifestyle, diet, and social structures over the last few centuries or even decades are out of sync with the slow pace of human evolution.



All living humans are descendants of ancestors who were nomadic hunter-gathers. Our ancestors lived in small tribes of about 50-100 individuals (Dunbar 1993).  
- Natural selection pressure shaped human psychology to solve problems specifically in  
this kind of environment.  

Mismatch Theory highlights that brain evolution take many thousands of years, but our environments change much more quickly (Nesse and Williams 1994).  
- That means, people interact with their present-day world using brains that evolved to confront ancestral (‘Stone Age’) problems.  
- As a consequence, brain functions that were adaptive in the past are irrelevant, or even maladaptive, in the present.


### Example
We evolved in a world where calories and nutrients were scarce.  
- Having a high desire for foods high in sugar and fat was a survival-relevant mechanism.  
- ‘Sugar- and fat-loving’ individuals had a higher rate of survival, therefore higher reproduction rates (natural selection).  

The modern world is characterized by an abundance of affordable calories, which therefore can easily lead to obesity etc.
