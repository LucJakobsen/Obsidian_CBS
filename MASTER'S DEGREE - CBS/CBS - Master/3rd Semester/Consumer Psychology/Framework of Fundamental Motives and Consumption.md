The "Framework of Fundamental Motives and Consumption," relates to [[Evolutionary Psychology]] and suggests that certain core psychological motives, developed through human evolutionary history, continue to have a significant impact on consumer behavior today. 

According to the authors Griskevicius and Kenrick (2013), these fundamental motives are:
1. **[[Evading Physical Harm]]**: Choosing products or services that enhance safety.
2. **[[Avoiding Disease]]**: Preferring cleanliness and products that promote health.
3. **[[Affiliation]] (Making Friends)**: Engaging in social consumption to foster relationships.
4. **[[Attaining Status]]**: Seeking goods that elevate social standing.
5. **[[Acquiring a Mate]]**: Selecting items that enhance attractiveness or courtship.
6. **[[Retaining the Mate]]**: Investing in resources that maintain relationships.
7. **[[Caring for Family]]**: Purchasing with the well-being of kin in mind.

These motives are deeply ingrained and can influence a vast array of consumer behaviors, from the mundane to the complex. Understanding these can help explain why people make certain purchasing decisions and how marketers can tailor their strategies to align with these underlying motives.


### Additional Motives
The fundamental motives from Griskevicius and Kenrick (2013) may not be the only motives that guide consumer behavior. As an example **[[Exploration]]** may also be a motive.
