Principle 3 for Increasing Consumer Happiness through consumption ([[Money & Happiness]]), is as follows:
	***(3) Buy many small pleasures instead of few big ones***

- Reason I: We easily adapt to new purchases.  
- Reason II: Happiness is more strongly associated with the frequency than the intensity of people's positive affective experiences (Diener, Sandvik and Pavot 1991).  
- Reason III: Small pleasures are less susceptible to diminishing marginal utility, e.g., eating one 50g cookie is not as pleasurable as eating two 25g cookies (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Thaler 1999).
