Consumer Boycott is a type of negative consumer-brand relationship (see [[Brands]]), and refers to a coordinated effort by consumers to avoid purchasing products or services from a specific company or brand as a form of protest



Klein et al. (2004) identify two key motivations for consumer boycotts:  
1. **Make a difference:** The motivation to bring about societal, political or environmental change by participating in a boycott
	- e.g., forcing a company to change its supply chain
2. **Self enhancement:** 
	a) feeling guilty if I bought
	b) feeling uncomfortable if other people watched me buying/using
	c) feeling better/proud/retaliation when boycotting.

Not only consumers boycott, but also firms!
