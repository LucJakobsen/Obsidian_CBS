The Consumer Attraction‐Repulsion Matrix is a framework that categorizes consumer attitudes towards domestic and foreign products into four quadrants based on attraction and repulsion. It lists four different types of [[Consumer Biases]].

1. **Quadrant 1 - Attraction to Domestic Country (Consumer [[Ethnocentrism]])**: This quadrant represents consumers who prefer domestic products due to ethnocentric beliefs, as explained by Shimp and Sharma (1987). These consumers are attracted to local products, potentially because they believe buying domestic supports the local economy or aligns with patriotic sentiments.
    
2. **Quadrant 2 - Repulsion to Domestic Country ([[Consumer Disidentification]])**: Here, consumers are repulsed by or actively avoid domestic products, perhaps due to negative perceptions of their country's products or disillusionment with national policies or practices.
    
3. **Quadrant 3 - Attraction to Foreign Country ([[Consumer Affinity]])**: This quadrant captures consumers who are attracted to foreign products, which could be due to a fascination with or affinity for other cultures, as discussed by Oberecker, Riefler, and Diamantopoulos (2008). They may perceive foreign products as more exotic, of higher quality, or more aligned with their personal values or identity.
    
4. **Quadrant 4 - Repulsion to Foreign Country ([[Animosity]])**: Consumers in this quadrant feel animosity towards foreign products, possibly due to historical conflicts, political disagreements, or perceived threats to the domestic economy. This concept is explored by Klein, Ettenson, and Morris (1998), suggesting that such consumers may boycott or avoid products from certain countries due to these negative feelings.
