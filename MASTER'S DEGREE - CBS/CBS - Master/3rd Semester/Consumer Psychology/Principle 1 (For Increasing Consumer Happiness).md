Principle 1 for Increasing Consumer Happiness through consumption ([[Money & Happiness]]), is as follows:
	***(1) Buy more experiences and fewer material goods***

Consumers with high financial constraints (i.e. less disposable money) often spend much more on material goods than on experiences.  
- **Reason I**: They have a high concern about the lasting value (longevity) of their purchases.  
- **Reason II:** They experience a status threat more often and therefore engage more in compensatory status consumption (remember Lecture 7!)  

These results indicate that financially constrained consumers spend their money in a way that does not maximize their happiness.  
- This further increases the ‘happiness’-gap between more wealthy and less wealthy
