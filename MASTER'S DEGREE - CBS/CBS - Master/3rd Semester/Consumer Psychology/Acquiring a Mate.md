Acquiring a Mate is a core psychological motive developed through human evolutionary history that continue to have a significant impact on consumer behavior today. It is a part of the [[Framework of Fundamental Motives and Consumption]].

Even if humans manage:
- to avoid physical harm (motive 1)  
- to avoid diseases (motive 2)  
- while getting others to like them (motive 3)  
- And to respect them (motive 4)....  
...it would not count (in terms of evolution) if they did not find someone willing to transport their genes into the next generation!  

The mate-acquisition system is triggered by the presence of real or imagined potential mates.  

The emotion that signals mating to the individual is sexual desire, lust or love (sometimes..).

### Men and Women and their Relation to Mating Cues 
([[Costly Signaling Theory]])
***Exposing men to mating cues..***
- Increases their willingness to purchase luxury goods (Griskevicius et al. 2007).  
- Men also become more creative (Griskevicius et al. 2006), charitable (Iredale et al. 2008), manipulative (Ackerman et al. 2011) and heroic (Griskevicius et al. 2007).  
- Men become less risk averse (Li et al. 2012) and more impulsive (Wilson and Daly 2004).  

For example, touching a piece of womenâ€™s lingerie led men to prefer small but immediate rewards over significantly larger but later rewards (Van den Bergh et al. 2008).  

When women are scarce (in a group/country), men save less money and are  
more willing to use credit cards for immediate purchases (Griskevicius et al. 2012)


***Exposing women to mating cues..***
- Increases their effort to advertise their beauty (Kenrick and Keefe 1992).  
- Increase their financial investment in cosmetics and fashion.  
- Increase their time investment in learning make-up techniques.  
- Increases their willingness to take diet pills and tan their bodies to enhance their appearance, even if they know that doing so can cause cancer (Hill and Durante 2011).  
- Makes them become more helpful and cooperative, and show this to others (Griskevicius et al. 2007).  

The Lipstick Effect: Women spend significantly more on beauty products during an  
economic decline in order to attract mating partners in unstable times (Hill et al. 2012)
