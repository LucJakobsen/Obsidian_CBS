Affiliation refers to the desire to belong to or be associated with a group or individual - in other words: Making friends. It is a core psychological motive developed through human evolutionary history that continue to have a significant impact on consumer behavior today. It is a part of the [[Framework of Fundamental Motives and Consumption]].

Humans have always lived in groups in order to increase probability of survival (Hill and Hurtado 1996) through sharing resources (e.g., food, knowledge, shelter). 
- Today, having friends is important as well, and most people invest heavily in it. 

Emotions that signal affiliation are, among others, **liking, attraction, harmony or  
feeling sentimental**.  

An affiliation system promotes people to reinforce existing and make new friendships. When this system is triggered, people: 
- Spend more money on products and services that can be enjoyed together rather than consumed alone (Mead et al. 2010).  
- Increase gift-giving (Ward and Broniarczyk 2011)

### Affiliation & Consumers
Many products and services primarily address affiliation needs of consumers, particularly empowered through the internet:  
- Smartphones in general, and social networks in particular directly increase contact with friends.  
- [[Brands]] often address an affiliation motive by allowing consumers to seek meaning and styles shared by others (e.g., clothing, consumer electronics).  
- People concerned with affiliation may also be more susceptible to word-of-mouth information of others.  
	- Recall [[Brand Communities]] as a means to address affiliation needs.
