Xenophobia is the fear or hatred of strangers, foreigners, or anything that is strange or foreign. 


Meeting and interacting with foreigners and strangers was a particularly threatening situation for our ancestors ([[Mismatch Theory]]): Foreigners spread unknown and dangerous diseases, could try to conquer the own tribe’s territory and compete for scarce resources. 
- Xenophobia was therefore a highly survival-relevant mechanism for our ancestors.  
- People living in areas that were often subject to diseases (i.e. plaque, Ebola) have higher levels of xenophobia.  
- Women’s avoidance system is activated through pregnancy hormones: Pregnant women are more xenophobic than non-pregnant women (Navarrete et al. 2007).


### Relation to the Motive "[[Avoiding Disease]]"
Xenophobia can be related to the motive of "avoiding disease" through a psychological and social mechanism where individuals or groups associate outsiders with potential health risks. Historically and prehistorically, contact with outsiders often carried a risk of exposure to new pathogens against which a community had little or no immunity. Here’s the connection:

- **Fear of Contagion**: Xenophobic tendencies may be exacerbated by the fear that foreigners could introduce new diseases to a population. This fear can trigger a defensive response to avoid potential health risks by shunning or discriminating against those who are perceived as 'other' or foreign.
    
- **Protection of In-group**: Xenophobia can manifest as a misguided protective measure, where individuals believe they are safeguarding their community's health by avoiding contact with outsiders who are irrationally deemed as carriers of diseases.
    
- **Psychological Response**: The reaction is rooted in a deep-seated evolutionary drive to survive; thus, the aversion to foreigners may be an unconscious response to a perceived threat of illness, even when such a threat is minimal or nonexistent.
