Caring for Family is a core psychological motive developed through human evolutionary history that continue to have a significant impact on consumer behavior today. It is a part of the [[Framework of Fundamental Motives and Consumption]].

The ultimate reason for why parents bond is because it is good for the offspring. 

In the modern world, people continue to spend immense amounts of time, money and  
energy to care for the family and to raise their children

The kin care system is activated by children (Glocker et al. 2009). Activating the kin care system results in:  
- Higher willingness to provide social support (Kivett 1985)  
- Charity-giving (Smith et al. 1987)  
- Higher willingness to provide physical protection (Daly and Wilson 1988)

### Spending on Family & Gender
Evolutionary theories view parental spending as a way to maximize the parents’ long-term re-productive success (Bugental and Beaulieu 2004): The well-being of the offspring will result in higher re-production rates of the parents’ genes.  
- In economic recessions, parents spend more on their daughters.  
- In economic prosperity, parents spend more on their sons


### Cute Products & Kin Care
Kin care can be targeted by marketers through the usage of "cutre products" - [[Anthropomorphic Products]] made to look closer to children or have child-like features. Cuteness triggers the evolutionary motive of kin care, resulting in positive consumer responses
