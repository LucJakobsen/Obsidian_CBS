In the context of the European Union (EU), regulations are [[Legislation|legislative]] acts that are directly applicable and binding in their entirety in all EU Member States.

Regulations must be implemented and enforced in their entirety by all Member States as soon as they [[come into force]].

Regulations are one of the primary means by which the EU creates harmonized laws and regulations that apply across all Member States.


The key difference between [[Directive|directives]] and regulations is that regulations *must* be implemented entirely in each member state, while directives essentially just say "you have to fulfill these goals, you can figure out how to do so yourself".
