Regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a [[Dependent Variable|dependent variable]] and one or more [[Independent Variable|independent variables]]. It is often used for prediction or to identify which independent variables have the strongest association with the dependent variable.

###### It's basically the stuff where you have a scatter plot and try to fit a line that hits the most points as possible

When you perform regression, you make an estimation of the actual coefficients
- Typically it's better to predict a [[Confidence Interval]] rather than a specific value

### Regression equation
``Y = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bnXn``

**Y** is the predicted value of the dependent variable

**b0** is the intercept

**b1, b2, ..., bn** are the regression coefficients (measure of change, so if x increases by 1, how much does y increase with)

**X1, X2, ..., Xn** are the values of the independent variables.



Regression can also be used to measure [[Interaction Effects]], more specifically you can use [[OLS Regression]].

Regression can also come in the form of [[Logistic Regression]].
