Properties are specific features or characteristics of an [[Object|object]] (or [[Construct|construct]]) that can be used to distinguish it from another object (construct).


##### Properties can be **objective** or **subjective**:
- **Objective properties** = properties which are physically verifiable
	- Often seen when measuring objects

- **Subjective properties** = mental constructs
	- Cannot be directly observed, such as a personâ€™s attitudes, opinions, or intentions.
	- Often seen when measuring constructs


To determine how much of a property is possessed by an object (or construct), you perform a [[Measurement|measurement]].
