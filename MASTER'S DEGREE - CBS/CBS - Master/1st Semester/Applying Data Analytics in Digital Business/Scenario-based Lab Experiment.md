A scenario-based lab experiment, also known as a vignette study, is a type of [[Experiment]], which presents a hypothetical situation to which research participants repond revealing their perceptions, values, social norms, or impression of events
- So basically you say "how do you feel about this made-up scenario" / "imagine you are in this situation"


#### General Process:
- You offer participants a description of a situation  
- You randomly allocate participants to your treatment conditions  
- You observe/measure how they respond  
- These type of experiments are contingent on participantsâ€™ capacity to imagine they are in the hypothetical situation. Nonetheless, they have shown to produce results with [[External Validity|external validity]] that can be generalized outside of the study context
	- I.e. you don't know if this is actually how they will react
