The T-test is a ...

to compare the differences between two means - unlike the [[ANOVA]] which can test for more than two means.


With a 95% [[Confidence Interval]], we will reject the null hypothesis if the P-value if below 0.05. Thereby stating that there is a difference.

If the P-value is above 0.05 we cannot reject the null hypothesis, meaning that there is no difference.
