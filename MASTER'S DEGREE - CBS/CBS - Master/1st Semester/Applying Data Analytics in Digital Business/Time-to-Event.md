Time-to-event refers to the amount of time it takes for an event of interest to occur. 
- Or fancily: "*the primary endpoint is the time from entering a study until a subject has a particular event occur*"


The event can be any outcome that is of interest to a researcher, such as death, disease recurrence, failure, or any other event that occurs over time.
