Carry-over Effect, also known as Learning Effect, is when the participants' experience may lead to them learning something from one treatment that they can use / will carry over to the next treatment

The carry-over effect can be assymetric:
- You may learn something from treatment A that is relevant for treatment B, but not the other way around so you don't learn anything for treatment A from treatment B

Carry-over effects are mostly relevant to [[Within-subject Experiment|within-subject experiments]]

Randomization helps reduce the carry-over effect
- Also helps to conduct a pilot-test to see if anything is learned from each treatment
