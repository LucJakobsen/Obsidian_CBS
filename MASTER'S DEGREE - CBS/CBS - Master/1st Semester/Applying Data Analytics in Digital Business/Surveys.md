Surveys are research instruments used to collect data from a [[Population|population]] or [[Sample|sample]] of people. 
The purpose of a survey is to gather information about a particular [[Construct|construct]], by examining the construct's various [[Properties|properties]].
- It's about trying to explain and find patterns in reality based on collected data
- Helps you measure variables you can't directly measure (constructs)


Surveys can be conducted using a variety of methods, also known as [[Survey Modes|survey modes]].

The success of survey research depends on how close the answers that people give to survey questions match how people think and act in reality. 


#### Survey Design
For surveys, the design is important. Badly designed surveys can lead unpredictable and damaging results (for the business). 
- Wrong results / wrong predictions can damage the reputation of those who conducted the survey

To help ensure correct results and predictions, researchers can take measures to reduce the [[Total Survey Error (TSE)]]. 

#### Why a Survey?
-   Good tool to discover the feelings, attitudes, perceptions, opinions, etc.
-   Results are more generalizable than case studies as it is based on a big sample
-   As a tool to collect demographic data in experiments
-   Very popular in consulting companies, marketing departments, and for feedback collection

-   Big data cannot always explain everything - sometimes we need better insight into feelings, perceptions etc.
	-   E.g. user experience
