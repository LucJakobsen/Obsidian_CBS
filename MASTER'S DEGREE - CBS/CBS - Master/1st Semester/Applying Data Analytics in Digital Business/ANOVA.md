Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a technique used to compare the means of two or more groups. I.e. it's used to analyze the differences among group means in a [[Sample]]. 

Like a [[T-test]], it determines whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the groups or not. 
- Think of ANOVA as equivalent to the T-test when you have more than two means

ANOVA is a so-called *omnibus test* as several parameters are tested against each other at the same time

ANOVA provides an [[F-statistic]], along with a [[P-value]].
