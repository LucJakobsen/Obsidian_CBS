The confidence interval is an interval which states where the unknown (but true) value will be

Typically we use a 95% confidence interval, saying that we can say with 95% certainty that the value will be within the interval

If the confidence interval contains the number 0, then the [[P-value]] is likely to very high, meaning that we can't reject the null hypothesis
