The P-value related to [[Significance Level]] blah blah

Whether the P-value is trustworthy or not depends on the size of the [[Sample]]. This is also known as [[Statistical Power]]. 
- The higher the sample, the more trustworthy
- Higher sample size we can detect smaller differences between groups
- If the sample size is too small we cannot confidently reject the [[Null Hypothesis]], as the sample is not representative of the [[Population]]

When analyzing the P-value, there are four possible outcomes, 2 in which we are right, and 2 in which we are wrong:

- The possible outcomes where we are wrong are when we either perform a [[Type 1 Error]] or a [[Type 2 Error]].
