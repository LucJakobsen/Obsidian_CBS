The Path Model is a type of [[Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)|structural equation model]], which specifies the hypothesized relationships between the latent variables ([[Construct|constructs]]) in the model.

In a path (structural) model, all the variables are measured (which are observed and concrete), and no measurement errors are assumed.

The constructs are represented as circles or ovals, and the paths between them are represented as arrows. 

The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of the hypothesized causal relationship, and the strength of the relationship is indicated by the weight or coefficient on the arrow.
