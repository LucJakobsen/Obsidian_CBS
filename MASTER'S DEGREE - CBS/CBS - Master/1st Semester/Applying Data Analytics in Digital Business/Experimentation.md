Experimentation is the process of conducting [[Experiment|experiments]], to determine the [[Causation|causal relationships]] between two [[Variable|variables]]. 

I.e. we first observe a relationship ([[Correlation]]) between two variables, then perform experimentation to see if there is any casuation and which variable influences which. 
- This is done by isolating the treatment by applying the same treatment to two similar samples

In experimentation, one variable is manipulated to see if it has a direct effect on another variable.


#### 3 Basic Principles of Experimental Design
1. Randomization
	- The order the experiments are conducted in and the [[Independent Variable|treatment factors]] in the experiment should be randomized to avoid bias and increase [[Reliability|reliability]]
	- Helps ensure no systematic differences between and within groups
2. Replication
	- The experimental runs/tests should be repeated several times
		- Gives estimate of experimental error
		- Makes the estimation of the effect more precise
3. Blocking
	- Grouping [[Extraneous Variable|extraneous variables]] and participants into "block" to achieve the same experimental conditions
	- Helps control for the effect of the extraneous variables
		- For example, in a study examining the effect of a new medication on blood pressure, age might be identified as an extraneous variable. Participants would be grouped into blocks based on their age, and then randomly assigned to treatment groups within each block.
