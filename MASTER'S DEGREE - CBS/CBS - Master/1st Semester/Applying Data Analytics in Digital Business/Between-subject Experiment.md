Between-subject Experiment, is a type of [[Experiment]], which refers to when participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more groups, and each group is exposed to a different treatment
- So participants are randomly allocated to only one combination of treatments

So you look at the treatmentÂ´s effect *between* different groups 

Each participant is exposed to only one treatment, and the researcher measures the outcome variable(s) for each group

The opposite of between-subject experiment would be a [[Within-subject Experiment]]

#### Example
In a study investigating the effect of a new medication on blood pressure, participants might be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group, which receives the medication, or the control group, which receives a placebo. 

The researcher would then measure the blood pressure of each participant after a certain period of time and compare the mean scores between the two groups to determine if the medication had a significant effect on blood pressure.

#### Importance of Randomization for Within-subject Design
Randomly assign participants to rule out unobserved characteristics that [[Bias|bias]] your results

### Advantages of Between-subject Design
- Minimizes the learning and transfer across conditions (minimizes carry-over effect)
- Shorter sessions per participant
- Easier to set up, especially when you have multiple [[Independent Variable|independent variables]] (randomization of treatment order)

### Disadvantages of Between-subject Design
- Need to recruit more participants
