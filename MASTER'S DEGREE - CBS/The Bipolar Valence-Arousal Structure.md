The Bipolar Valence-Arousal Structure is a concept used in psychology to describe and categorize [[Emotions]] based on two independent dimensions: valence and arousal.


1. **Valence** refers to the intrinsic attractiveness (positive valence) or averseness (negative valence) of an event, object, or situation. In simpler terms, it indicates how pleasant or unpleasant an emotion is. 
	- E.g. happiness has a positive valence, while sadness has a negative valence.

2. **Arousal** refers to the physiological and psychological state of being awake or reactive to stimuli. It ranges from high arousal, which is characterized by feelings such as excitement or anger, to low arousal, characterized by states such as calmness or sadness.

#### Shortcomings
A large shortcoming of the model is that it doesn't really reflect reality accurately.
- The model posits that one can feel happy and pleased but at the same time one is unlikely to report feeling blue or lonely
- Put differently, unpleasant and pleasant emotions are opposite poles and can't be felt at the same time
	- Which is not necessarily true
- So the model is pretty outdated
