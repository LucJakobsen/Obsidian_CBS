The Stereotype Content Model (SCM), developed by Susan Fiske and her colleagues, is a theory related to [[Stereotyping]] that suggests all individuals and whole groups are categorized and perceived along two personality dimensions: **Warmth and Competence**.  
- **Warmth** entails empathetic, friendly, trustworthy, polite or agreeable.  
- **Competence** entails expertise, capability, competitiveness, skill or power.

According to this model, people typically judge others based on whether they have friendly intentions (warmth) and whether they have the ability to carry out those intentions (competence).


Based on these two dimensions, the SCM posits four types of stereotypes:
1. **Paternalistic Stereotypes**: Groups perceived as warm but not competent, leading to feelings of pity or sympathy (often associated with traditional women or elderly people).
    
2. **Admiration Stereotypes**: Groups seen as high in both warmth and competence, evoking feelings of admiration (often associated with in-group members or close allies).
    
3. **Envious Stereotypes**: Groups viewed as competent but not warm, leading to feelings of envy and jealousy (often associated with rich people or successful professionals).
    
4. **Contemptuous Stereotypes**: Groups seen as neither warm nor competent, evoking contempt or disgust (often associated with poor people or homeless individuals).

### Compensatory Effect for Warmth and Competence
Holoien and Fiske (2013) document a compensatory effect between perceptions of warmth and competence: People who are perceived as warm are perceived as less competent, and the other way round.  
- As a consequence, people often downplay their warmth (act less friendly and cold) when they want to appear competent. Analogously, they downplay their competence when they want to appear warm.  
- However, downplaying warmth can easily backfire: People who act less warm in order to appear objective or ‚professional‘ can be perceived as arrogant, cold, and untrustworthy

### Stereotyping and [[Emotions]]
Cuddy, Fiske et al. argue that certain combinations of warmth and competence  
predict specific emotions
