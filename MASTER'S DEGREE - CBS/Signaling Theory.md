Signaling theory comes from the animal kingdom where it is the use of specialized, species-typical morphology or behavior to influence the current or future behavior of another individual
- So e.g. signal to possible mates that they are fertile etc.


However, it not only happens in the animal kingdom but also among humans. 
- E.g. fashion statements etc.

It's basically when we try to project an image of ourselves. So like dining at expensive restaurants. 

It relates to [[Consumer Images]]. 


Another theory that relies on signaling, is the [[Stimulus-response Theory]].
