Causal inference requires a rich language in the form of diagrams - not just the numbers of probabilities etc.


Causal analysis allows us to quantify processes in the real world, not just patterns in the data

Causal analysis is emphatically not just about data; in causal analysis we must incorporate some understanding of the process that produces the data, and then we get something that was not in the data to begin with

Causal analysis requires the user to make a subjective commitment, so its not 100% objective like looking at data is.
