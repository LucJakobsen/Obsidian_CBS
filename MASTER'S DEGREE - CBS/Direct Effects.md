Consider the simplest case, which includes three variables: 
1. a treatment X, 
2. an outcome Y,
3. a mediator M. 
 
We get the direct effect of X on Y when we “wiggle” X without allowing M to change


### Controlled Direct Effects


The opposite of the controlled direct effect is the natural direct effect
