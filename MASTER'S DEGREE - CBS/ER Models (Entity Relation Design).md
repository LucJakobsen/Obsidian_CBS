ER Models are high-level conceptual data models that are used in the initial design and analysis of [[Databases]]. 
- The ER model allows database designers to visualize the logical structure and relationships between different data elements without delving into physical storage details.

So i.e. the ER Models show the entities, their relations, and what type of relations they have.
- E.g. one-to-many, or many-to-one

**Examples:**
